The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one. The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. To quote the study’s authors, “One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.” Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue. The final task Ms. Catron and her friend try — staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes — is less well documented, with the suggested duration ranging from two minutes to four. But Ms. Catron was unequivocal in her recommendation. “Two minutes is just enough to be terrified,” she told me. “Four really goes somewhere.” Set I 1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest? 2. Would you like to be famous? In what way? 3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why? 4. What would constitute a “perfect” day for you? 5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? 6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want? 7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? 8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common. 9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? 10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? 11. Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible. 12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? Set II 13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know? 14. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it? 15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life? 16. What do you value most in a friendship? 17. What is your most treasured memory? 18. What is your most terrible memory? 19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why? 20. What does friendship mean to you? 21. What roles do love and affection play in your life? 22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items. 23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s? 24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother? Set III 25. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling ... “ 26. Complete this sentence: “I wish I had someone with whom I could share ... “ 27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know. 28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met. 29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life. 30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself? 31. Tell your partner something that you like about them already. 32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about? 33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet? 34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why? 35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why? 36. Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen. Tales About Love to Nourish Your Soul Daniel Jones, who has edited the “Modern Love” column since it began in 2004, shares some of the most popular stories of 2021. ​ I Met My Husband on the Maternity Ward: A woman’s birth story is inextricably entwined with her decade-spanning love story . He Couldn’t Remember That We Broke Up: When her ex injured his brain, she became the sole repository of their shared memories . My Two-House, Duffel-Bag Life: A 15-year-old faces her parents’ divorce and learns to appreciate the constants in her life. Why Won’t Anyone Help Me in This Sex Shop?

            "32 Difficult Questions About Vulnerability To Ask Yourself Skip to content Main Menu Home Self Quotes Zodiac Signs Tattoo Write for Us 32 Difficult Questions About Vulnerability To Ask Yourself Vulnerability We can’t be strong without being vulnerable. So here is a list of vulnerability questions to ask yourself. I struggle a lot to embrace vulnerability . Being raised by a single mother, I always want myself to be like her: tough, resilient, and independent. And I grew up hiding my feelings and insecurities because I didn’t want anyone to regard me as a burden. But deep down, I know I have issues. I was in and out of relationships. I dated people that I wasn’t really into. I settled for convenience. And my insecurities played a big part in it. But I wasn’t aware. We all have fears, flaws, insecurities, and weaknesses. They make us human. But they can also impact our relationships and life. And sometimes we don’t even know what is holding us back. So I’ve rounded up a list of vulnerability questions to ask yourself. It may not be easy to face what you’ve been hiding from.  But when we stop pretending to be invincible, our fears become less intimidating. Read also: 49 Life-changing quotes about vulnerability from Brené Brown A list of vulnerability questions to know yourself better What was the last time you acted irrationally? What happened? Describe the most humiliating thing you’ve experienced? Name one harshest comment you’ve received. Have you ever felt like you disappointed yourself? Why? What worries you the most at the moment? What was the last time when you felt like everything is out of control? Are you scared of being lonely? Have you settled for less? If so, why? If you are moving to a new country alone, what terrifies you the most? Imagine you have one day left in your life, what do you regret not doing? Do you avoid asking for help? Do you often feel jealous? If so, why? How do you react to criticism? What decision you wish you’ve never made? Are you comfortable talking about your feelings? If a stranger presumes you as a bad person, what do you think is the reason? If someone says: “I have bad news for you,” what do you think happens? How will you describe your biggest failure so far? Have you lied about anything? Why? Name one thing you have given up for difficult reasons. What seems easy for everybody but you? What are your core values? Are you living by them? Describe one time you feel uncomfortable. Where were you? Who was around? What is your negative self-talk? Do you have anything you can’t get over with? If so, why? What is one critical risk you are facing now? What might still make you feel empty even when you are rich? Are you proud of being who you are? What is one thing you want to change about yourself? What question do you hate being asked? Have you ever felt excluded? What was the occasion? What misconception makes you want to scream, “that’s not me“? Read also: 23 thought-provoking questions to ask yourself How I identify my vulnerabilities with these questions? Just like you, maybe, I don’t have answers for all the questions. And it’s totally ok. As long as you are honest with yourself, you will learn something new. Here are some of my answers and how they help to strengthen my self-awareness: Question: Have you settled for less? If so, why? Answer: Yes, I have. I once dated a guy because I was scared to be single. I felt the need to get married and have kids, just like everyone else at my age. It took me three months to realize I couldn’t be with someone I don’t love. And I am still, scared to be judged as a single woman without kids. But I am more scared to be in a relationship that doesn’t spark joy. By answering this question, I realized the fear of being alone is not actually my vulnerability. The fear of being different is. And that’s something I need to work on. Questions: What was the last time you acted irrationally? What happened? Answer: Being called fat by my ex. I work out like crazy for the 3 following days. My adrenaline was powered by shame, which is not healthy. That made me realized I had always been insecure about my body . So I started to look in the mirror every day and learn to accept myself. My self-love is still a work in progress. But I am happy that I took the first step. What next? After answering these insecurity questions, you may have a list of your vulnerabilities. So how do you benefit from knowing your vulnerabilities? I love writing things down, just as how I do my brain-dump . Getting things on paper takes the burden off my mind. And I challenge you to: Write your vulnerabilities down on paper Review them every once in a while (I did every month) Cross out those you’ve overcome or are comfortable with Track your process in a bullet-journal Celebrate! I hope these strategies inspire you to beat your fear and self-doubts. Answering these vulnerabilitiy questions is hard. Facing your emotions is hard. But it’s only going to get better from here on.

January Tarot Creepy Catalog Sweatshirts TikTok Shop Catalog Wellness Style Collective World Adulting Psychology Questions 111 Loaded Questions That Reveal Someone’s Biggest Insecurities, Vulnerabilities And Emotional Baggage By Shahida Arabi Updated April 5, 2019 By Shahida Arabi Updated April 5, 2019 A loaded question is one that is ripe with assumption and the ability to unravel someone’s deepest desires, vulnerabilities and emotional baggage. It is a question that implies something about its listener; it presumes to know some aspect of that person’s being, personality, and preferences. These questions disrupt the listener’s usual ways of thinking and simultaneously uncover their true self. Due to its hidden implications, the person who asks the loaded question gains control over the dialogue and the person being asked caters their answer to only the context of the question. You can ask yourself these loaded questions to better understand yourself, or you can pose these questions to others to better understand them. Whether you’re dating someone new, building a new friendship or forging a business partnership, a loaded question can be an insightful way to discover the truth. However, it should be done in a time-appropriate and context-appropriate manner. One should not ask a loaded question without considering the other person’s sense of comfort or the nature of the relationship; normally these should be asked once you’ve already achieved a level of rapport, otherwise, you’re just shooting blanks. When asking loaded questions, always respect the boundaries of others. You must also be okay with the other person refusing to answer the question – sometimes their refusal will speak more volumes than their answer ever would, anyhow. Always be aware that a person may or may not answer honestly. In fact, some of these are so revealing that it’s very possible they won’t! Yet you can find out a lot about a person even just by the way they choose to respond. Here are 111 loaded questions you’ll want to ask that can help you reveal someone’s true self: 1. What’s your favorite strategy for avoiding tough situations? 2. How often do you do things just for the attention? 3. Would you prefer to be manipulated or to be the manipulator? 4. What did your previous partners always tell you to do more of? 5. What did your previous partners always tell you to do less of? 6. Who do you look to blame when things go wrong? 7.

Brides's Editorial Guidelines Updated on 08/22/21 FACEBOOK PINTEREST EMAILSHARE Getty Images Back in 1967, coincidentally the \"summer of love,\" social psychologist and professor Arthur Aron developed 36 questions that spark connection and intimacy between two people. He then spent decades researching love and published the study in 1997. And while no one question can actually guarantee love and connection, the notion that active listening and mutual vulnerability—the willingness to really open yourself up to and receive someone else—can build empathy, trust, and warmth. Probing questions also tend to reveal someone's values, qualities, fears, and personal past, so even if they don't lead to love or you're already in love, they also help you learn a lot about your partner, friends, and self. So with Aron's questions as inspiration, we came up with 30 questions of our own to ask your partner, friends, or even yourself when you want to dig a little deeper. Whether you find yourself sitting in a long car drive with a loved one, or you simply want to get to know someone on a deeper level, these 30 questions to ask your partner will definitely beget some interesting conversations (or journal entries if you want to treat them as introspective prompts). 30 Questions What is your most irrational fear? What's your most rational fear? What's the biggest risk you've ever taken that didn't pay off? What's one risk you took that that did pay off? How do you think you will die? Do you wish you were raised differently? Why? What quality do you wish you had? What's one thing you wish you were really good at? Would you rather spend a day with your kindergarten self or your elderly self? Why? What's your favorite childhood memory? What's your favorite early adulthood memory? If today were your last day to live, and your life suddenly flashed before your eyes, would you be proud and satisfied with how you lived? What has been your greatest accomplishment in life? What memory keeps you up at night? What mistake you've made keeps you up at night? What are your favorite characteristics of each other? Is your family warm and affectionate? When was the last time you cried? Is there anything you've been holding onto you that you want to get off your chest? What were you like at school as a kid? Did you ever get detention for anything? What for? What do you think the hallmark of a good relationship is? What would you title your memoir? If you could have a time machine for a week, what three eras would you visit and who would you be? Why? When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? Would your younger self be proud of who you are today? If your life were a novel or a movie, would you be entertained? Would you admire your own character and the decisions they've made? What are your simple pleasures in life? When was the last time you laughed until you cried? What or who did your parents name you after? What's your relationship like to your name? If you could get drinks with anyone dead or alive, who would it be? What are three things we have in common? What are three things we don't have in common? Is there anything you've been too afraid to say out loud to someone? 30 Conversation Starters for Texting That Go Beyond \"Hey\" Article Sources Brides takes every opportunity to use high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

By Jasmine Gomez and Lindsay Geller Oct 19, 2021 AndreyPopov Getty Images Sometimes, you meet someone, and you just click. You feel like you've been besties your entire life and honestly can't believe there was a time when you didn't even know they existed. And then, there's those other relationships that take a little more work—i.e., how it feels like pulling teeth to learn anything about your brother-in-law. While you might never be BFFs with your BIL, there is a trick you can use to get him to open up a little more. Terri Orbuch , PhD, author of 5 Simple Steps to Take Your Marriage from Good to Great , says getting to know someone starts with the \"breadth questions\"—think: impersonal but important biographical info about a person's family, their career, and if they’re single or married, for example. (Although if you're asking these q's of your BIL... you should probably definitely know the answer to that last one.) Tamekis Williams , LCSW, founder of Mission Dorothy Female Empowerment Services , adds that you want to ask open-ended questions that will allow the other person to elaborate, instead of questions that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" After all, if you really want to get to know someone beyond the surface level, you’ve got to dig deeper. \"Topics that get at the other person's inner world—their thoughts, goals, and dreams—will strengthen and increase bonding between two people,\" Orbuch notes. \"Sharing personal information strengthens any relationship, and deeper questions focus on that personal self-disclosure.\" Btw, that's a two-way street, adds Williams. \"When initially meeting someone, it is important to be inviting and warm so that the other person can initially feel comfortable talking with you.\" On that note, Williams suggests taking a careful approach in your questions, as you don't want the other person to feel like you're violating their privacy. Questions you should probably steer clear of early on: \"Democrat or Republican?\" \"Do you own or rent?\" and \"What is your faith or spiritual belief?\". There are other ways to bypass small talk and learn more in-depth info about the other person, says Williams. \"You can get the answers [you're looking for] by sometimes answering those questions yourself while sharing about you. An example would look like: 'I just moved to Georgia last year and found a beautiful community that I fell in love with and purchased a home. What about you, do you love where you live?'\" ➡ Join WH Stronger today and get unlimited access to digital content, exclusive workouts, and more! With a little patience, you'll become way closer with the person you're just getting to know in no time. Here are 200 not-boring questions to get you started: Likes \"Asking someone about their preferences helps you to understand who they are as a person,\" says Rebecca Hendrix , a therapist in New York. The important thing here is to go deeper by asking follow-up questions. For example, \"If you find out they like dogs, take it a bit deeper by asking them what they like most about their dog or their favorite breed,\" Hendrix explains. \"Commonalities often open the door for further conversation and, once that door is open, you can start a dialogue that allows the other person to elaborate and not give close-ended answers,\" Williams adds. Some other ideas: 1. What’s your favorite way to spend a day off? 2. What type of music are you into? 3. What was the best vacation you ever took and why? 4. Where’s the next place on your travel bucket list and why? 5. What are your hobbies, and how did you get into them? 6. What was your favorite age growing up? 7. What was the last thing you read? 8.

What's your favorite season and why? 30. What's the best joke you've ever heard?

What’s the best gift you’ve ever received? 50. What’s the worst gift you’ve ever received, and what did you do about it? Career No matter how a person feels about his or her job, the fact is, tons of people spend a lot of time and energy at work. To help you get to know someone better, \"facilitate a conversation where you are left knowing how they feel about their career,\" Hendrix says. Just prepare yourself to return that openness when they ask the same of you and your work life. \"Initial conversations set the tone for if the person wants to continue to get to know you, so be ready to answer some questions as well,\" Williams says.

Values \"In learning about someone’s values, you are learning about their owner’s manual,\" Hendrix explains. Even seemingly mundane questions can get at a person’s values—like what’s motivating them to do well on a presentation or what they look for in an S.O. \"By learning about someone’s life philosophy, you're able to get at their true essence, how they live their life, and what drives their actions,\" Orbuch adds. That said, you can't just ask, \"What are your values?\". What you can ask: 150. What do you think makes someone a “good person”? 151. Do you believe in love at first sight? 152.

Dreams \"These questions get at what the person is motivated by,\" says Orbuch. \"What gives them the strength to wake up every day and get going? What do they dream and think about in their day?\" When you learn about someone’s dreams, you share something more intimate. Jumpstart a deep conversation by asking this: 193. Do you think our dreams have hidden meanings? 194. When you want to give up, what keeps you going? 195. Do you live by any words of wisdom? 196. What's the first step you take in trying to achieve a new goal? 197. How do you turn a “no” into a “yes”? 198. What do you do to overcome a personal setback? 199.

A genie gives you three wishes—what are they? Unconventional questions Sometimes the oddball questions allow you to learn the most interesting things about a person. \"Unusual questions allow you to see the varied, unique, and special qualities of a person—their answers give you personal information about what makes them tick,\" Orbuch says. \"These questions also typically get the other person to think outside box and really ponder something.\" But you still want to keep things PG, says Williams. \"Be careful with asking questions of a sexual nature too early,\" she advises. Same goes for the unconventional-for-a-reason q's, a.k.a. anything related to another person's finances, but especially questions about child support, debt, and credit score. Ask these ~unconventional~ questions, and you'll definitely get some interesting (in a good way!) answers: 213. Do you believe in ghosts—why or why not? (Bonus question: If so, are you afraid of ghosts?) 214. Do you have any special skills? 215. Are you double-jointed? 216. What’s your game plan in a zombie apocalypse? 217.

If you could go back to anytime in history, where would you go? 227.  If you came back in your next life as an animal, what animal would you be? 228.

Do you think iced coffee should only be consumed in the summer or all year round? 235. Would you rather be covered in fur or covered in scales? 236. What’s your idea of a perfect date (yes, of the calendar year)? 237. What’s the most unusual place you’ve fallen asleep? 238. At a party, where can someone find you? 239. Do you wash your legs in the shower? 240. Who would play you in the movie of your life? 241. When making a PB&J sandwich, do you put on the peanut butter or jelly first? 242.

Would you rather have your dishes or clothes be magically clean? 259. What's your favorite story about yourself? 260. If you could change anything about yourself, would you? If so, what and why? \"Anytime you reveal personal information to someone else, it increases intimacy between you and the other person,\" says Orbuch.

I made it a bucket list challenge to spend one year reaching into the depths of my soul to answer all of these, sometimes difficult, thought provoking questions that are designed to inspire self-discovery, empowerment and happiness. Will you take the challenge? 365 Deep & Thought Provoking Questions to Ask Yourself (& Others) 1. When was the last time you tried something new? Just a few days ago my husband and I made Cognac Whole Grain Mustard for the first time and last night I tried a yummy new wine, Francis Ford Coppolas Reserve Syrah . 2. Who do you sometimes compare yourself to? When I compare myself to people, it is usually the ones that have acquired something that I desire. For example, I will watch Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations and see what makes him so popular, so that I can gain knowledge for when I write my weird food bucket lists . Though, I usually do this in a “I want to learn from the masters” sort of way, not through jealousy…okay maybe a teensy weensy bit of jealousy. 3. What’s the most sensible thing you’ve ever heard someone say? “Live in the present, forget about the past and don’t worry about the future.” I believe that one major key to happiness is living in the present, now if I could just completely master doing it! 4. What gets you excited about life? I am excited every time I am planning to have a new experience. It doesn’t matter if it is traveling to an exotic location, eating a weird food or attempting a new adventure. It is the time that I am the happiest. 5. What life lesson did you learn the hard way? I actually had previously answered this one in a previous post What I Know For Sure — Control only relates to you. You can only control yourself, no one else (damn). This has been a hard, tortuous, agonizing lesson to learn. Doesn’t everyone know that if they did it my way that life would be perfect? 6. What do you wish you spent more time doing five years ago? I wish I spent more time simplifying my life instead of just accumulating “stuff”. Now, I will be spending the next five years getting rid of the crap that I thought would enhance it, but has only complicated it. RELATED: 21 Ways to Simplify Your Life 7. Do you ask enough questions or do you settle for what you know? I learned a long time ago that when you are nervous about having conversations with people, just ask them a lot of questions about themselves, because ourselves is our favorite topic. So, I am typically pretty inquisitive. But, I also have an extremely curious nature that leads me to borderline annoy people with my interrogations. 8. Who do you love and what are you doing about it? I love my family, friends and husband, but I am willing to admit that I do not do enough about it! I have definitely fallen into the “taking the people you love for granted” and need to work on expressing how I feel. RELATED: Couples Bucket List: 23 Must-Do Experiences 9. What’s a belief that you hold with which many people disagree? That, for the most part, we create our destiny and it is not determined by “fate”. The decisions we make and opportunities we take are what create our lives. 10. Thought provoking questions: What can you do today that you were not capable of a year ago? Make a loaf of Focaccia from scratch, do the “Cupid Shuffle” line dance and make a homemade beauty cleanser from scratch. 11. Do you think crying is a sign of weakness or strength? I don’t necessarily think it’s a sign of either. It is simply an emotion that is felt when people feel sad, happy or scared. 12. What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you? Sell everything, travel the world and live in flip-flops, jeans and a tank top. 13. Do you celebrate the things you do have? Not nearly enough, though I try to live in a state of gratitude most of the time. Right now I am working on celebrating my 8 year old, rusty and door dinged Mitsubishi. It is taking a lot of effort on my part! RELATED: Being Grateful: 100 Things to Be Thankful For Today 14. What is the difference between living and existing? Existing is allowing the events in life to control you were as living is controlling the events in your life. 15. If not now, then when? It is now. If not, it is actively as soon as possible! 16. Have you done anything lately worth remembering? Saw the Dinosaurs of Spanishtown , made Cognac Mustard and ate Rabbit ! 17. What does your joy look like today? Today my joy came in the form of a little brown-eyed beauty queen (my niece) who I asked to make the sound that an owl makes. She replied, “Hoot…Hoooootttt! And I caught it all on video. 18. Is it possible to lie without saying a word? Absolutely, through body language, expressions and the eyes. Silence can be a lie. You can also lie to yourself with your thoughts. Are we all just big, fat liars? 19. If you had a friend who spoke to you in the same way that you sometimes speak to yourself, how long would you allow this person to be your friend? One short social outing and that’s just because I am overly polite! I once did an exercise where for one week I wrote down every negative thing I said to myself and if any of my friends or family would say those things to me they would be history! I can’t imagine any of them saying “your cellulite is looking especially bad today” or “why the heck would you write a blog, nobody wants to hear what you have to say.” 20. Thought provoking questions: Which activities make you lose track of time? Blogging, most new experiences, eating at a great restaurant with friends and planning amazing adventures. 21. If you had to teach something, what would you teach? Easy peasy, I would teach people how to step out of their box and create new experiences for themselves everyday. 22. What would you regret not fully doing, being or having in your life? I would regret if I didn’t feel like I made a sincere effort to follow my passion and use it to create the career of my dreams. 23. Are you holding onto something that you need to let go of? yes…I’ll tell ya after I do 😉 24. When you are 80-years-old, what will matter to you the most? Looking back on a life filled with memories, experiences and love. Not having regrets for the things I never did, just being grateful for taking the opportunities that were presented to me. 25. When is it time to stop calculating risk and rewards and just do what you know is right? When you decide it’s time! I believe I am a good person. I believe I know right from wrong. Still, I sometimes question my actions based on rewards and risk. Stopping…right now!!!! 26. How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you are? Early 30ish. I seem to bond with people that age best, possibly because we are still motivated to accomplish all our goals. It also seems to be the perfect age where you feel like an adult, but still young enough to make stupid learning mistakes! 27. Would you break the law to save a loved one? Possibly a misdemeanor, probably not a felony 🙂 It’s not that my heart wouldn’t want to, it’s just that I get nervous jaywalking. 28. What makes you smile? Puppies, great food, laughing babies, hearing “I Love You” from someone I love and new experiences. 29. When it’s all said and done, will you have said more than you’ve done? Unfortunately, I have said…a lot! Which means that I have absolutely said more than I have done, but I have done a freakin’ lot! Just take a peek at all the checks on my bucket list …But, I am no where near done yet! 30. Thought provoking questions: If you had the opportunity to get a message across to a large group of people, what would your message be? Life is unpredictable and now is the time to lie your dreams, have new experiences and inspire others. Take at least a baby step to your goals everyday. 31. If the average human lifespan was 40 years, how would you live your life differently? Oh Crap! I would probably be dead right now and that would be just terrible…too much left to do! I would concentrate more on creating memorable experiences, rather than acquiring “things”. 32. What do we all have in common besides our genes that makes us human? We all have the ability to choose whether we want to live a happy, optimistic life or a sad, gloomy one. We have the ability to perceive things in a positive or negative light. 33. If you could choose one book as a mandatory read for all high school students, which book would you choose? The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle which teaches people the importance of being present. Eckhart believes that living in the now is the truest path to happiness. Follow that book up with Tolles’ A New Earth and high school kids will be on a path to enlightenment. Not that they really care about anything else but cars, dating and parties! 34. Would you rather have less work or more work you actually enjoy doing? Both…I am a dreamer after all. 35. What is important enough to go to war over? Protecting the people of our Country. 36. Which is worse, failing or never trying? Of course never trying, because if you try you did not fail. 37. When was the last time you listened to the sound of your own breathing? This morning. I try to start my day with a quick one minute meditation while lying in bed. I follow that by listing five things I am grateful for. It’s a great way to start your day before your feet even touch the ground and the chaos begins. 38. What’s something you know you do differently than most people? View life. I believe that just about anything is possible and I am constantly trying to achieve something. 39. What does ‘The American Dream’ mean to you? Designing your life instead of letting it take control of you. Creating many memorable experiences and inspiring others. 40. Thought provoking questions: Would you rather be a worried genius or a joyful simpleton? A joyful simpleton, because I have learned that ignorance is, most of the time, bliss. 41. If you could instill one piece of advice in a newborn baby’s mind, what advice would you give? Don’t take life too seriously, live in the present and, as trite as it may sound, do unto others as you wish them to do unto you. Yes, I know that was more than “one piece” of advice, but since I’m the one doing the writing… 42. What is the most desirable trait another person can possess? Having a sense of curiosity. I’m not sure that this is the most desirable trait ever, but it is the one that is speaking loudly to me today. 43. What are you most grateful for? That I have the capacity to learn and experience. 44. Is stealing to feed a starving child wrong? I would have to hesitantly say “yes”, unless EVERY other possibility for feeding the child has been exhausted. 45. What do you want most? Right now, to simplify my life and concentrate more on creating amazing experiences. 46. Are you more worried about doing things right, or doing the right things? Definitely doing the right things. I now know that perfection is a myth, so I am more concerned about not breaking the law or hurting peoples feelings 😉 47. What has life taught you recently? That it is unpredictable, that people you trust will disappoint you and that the one key to happiness is being confident that you will survive no matter what life has to throw at you. 48. What is the one thing you would most like to change about the world? I wish that all people, whether they be politicians, world leaders or family, would embrace and accept each others differences. Yea, yea…I know that’s never going to happen. 49. Where do you find inspiration? Everywhere. The beach, reading other travel blogs , with inside myself, movies or television shows, from people who are successful at their passion, etc… Your mind just has to be open to seeking out the positive benefits in any scenario you are in. 50. Thought provoking questions: Can you describe your life in a six word sentence? Filled with learning and new experiences. 51. If we learn from our mistakes, why are we always so afraid to make a mistake? Because there is a misconception that perfection exists in every situation. People, unfortunately, are not perfect. Yes…I know…that sucks. 52. What impact do you want to leave on the world? I hope that I will be remembered as an adventurous woman who experienced life to the fullest and inspired people to do the same. 53. What is the most defining moment of your life thus far? I have to admit that, even though I have been writing this post for over two weeks, I saved this question for last. Can you really just pick ONE moment, because I have had several in each chapter of my life? So, here goes me vomiting my blatant honesty: A grandmothers death, a family member getting sober, a “16-year sober” family member getting drunk, an infidelity, seeing a man I love cry, seeing a child in pain, visiting a drug addict relative in jail, knowing that I am the only one I can truly trust (& maybe not even 100%), admitting to having anxiety and overcoming. 54. In the haste of your daily life, what are you not seeing? My husbands need for my affection, my mothers need to spend time with her only daughter and the everyday laughter of my young niece. Ouch…that was just a very painful realization. 55. If life is so short, why do we do so many things we don’t like and like so many things we don’t do? Because we have complicated our lives with attempting to keep up with the “Joneses” and now we have to work our butts off to pay for it. Many of us are just “too tired” to try something new and too overwhelmed to take on the new task of finding our passion. Oh…and because, television has helped to fill the void by occupying our free time with watching people living the lives we should be (no, I am not just talking about The Real Housewives of…wherever!). 56. What lifts your spirits when life gets you down? Puppies breath, babies laughter, any new experience and sinking my toes in the sand while watching the waves crash against the shore. 57. Have you ever regretted something you did not say or do? I don’t have too many regrets because I try to live in the present moment and not think to much about the past. With that said, there are still times that I wish I could be more expressive about how I feel to the people that I love. It’s a work in progress…just like me 🙂 58. Has your greatest fear ever come true? Nope and having suffered from anxiety in the past, I had a butt-load of them! I have been working for several years on retraining my mind to not obsess over things that have not happened and stay in the present. Though I sometimes fail (like whenever I am flying), I try to worry about the bad things as they hit. 59. Why do we think of others the most when they’re gone? Because you don’t have the ability to create anymore memories with them, so you are forced to relive the ones you already had. 60. What is your most beloved childhood memory? I have a fond memory of sitting at my grandmothers kitchen table and “helping” her to make homemade pasta . Growing up in a loud and mostly chaotic Italian family, this memory captures a rare peaceful time. Answering this question has made me realize that I do regret not telling my grandmother how much I loved her (see #57) and now I am forced to relive the beautiful memories I have (#59). 61. Is it more important to love or be loved? To love, because then you have more of an opportunity to be loved back. 62. If it all came back around to you, would it help you or hurt you? Hopefully help, because I have always tried to be a good, honest woman. My intentions 99% of the time (you gotta give me the 1% rebel factor) are of that from a decent place. For Heavens sake, I cry watching Kleenex commercials! 63. If you had the chance to go back in time and change one thing would you do it? Spend more time with my grandmother learning more about her childhood and Italian traditions. 64. If a doctor gave you five years to live, what would you try to accomplish? I would systematically go through my bucket list, accomplish every goal on it and bring all my family & friends along for the ride! 65. What is the difference between falling in love and being in love? Falling in love is the butterflies in the stomach as you are learning more about a person and are excited by all the things that you are uncovering. Being in love is the feeling of unconditional support, companionship, contentment, deep affection and respect (bonus if you still get little flutters in your tummy). 66. Who do you think stands between you and happiness? Only myself. I believe that we are in charge of our own happiness and we choose how we feel about most circumstances we are faced with. 95% of the time that I am not happy, it is because I have chosen to have a negative outlook that day. 67. What is the difference between innocence and ignorance? Innocence is not having been exposed to the information to have an opinion, whereas, ignorance is choosing to ignore the information that is available to you. 68. What is the simplest truth you can express in words? Living in the present moment is the key to happiness. 69. What gives your life meaning? Achievement, love, inspiration, learning and experience. 70. Thought provoking questions: Can there be happiness without sadness? Pleasure without pain? Peace without war? Yes, but if we never experience sadness or pain, we wouldn’t know how to identify our happiness or pleasure. 71. What’s the one thing you’d like others to remember about you at the end of your life? That I lived life to the fullest, inspired others to do the same and was a good-spirited person. 72. Is there such a thing as perfect? Perfection is a perception, just like beauty. If you think something is perfect or beautiful than it is. A flower that is missing a pedal or starting to shrivel may be seen as perfection to somebody. So, yes, perfection does exist, the definition just varies from person to person. 73. To what degree have you actually controlled the course your life has taken? I am not a believer in fate, I believe that my choices have created my life in most situations. Every opportunity I have said “yes” to (or “No”), with a few uncontrollable factors thrown in, has led me to where I am today. I have always come from a place of “yes-I-can” (& “don’t-you-dare-tell-me-I-can’t”) and am motivated by knowing that I am the driver in my life. 74. What does it mean to be human? To have an array of feelings, to develop personal relationships and to be able to ask “why”. 75. If you looked into the heart of your enemy, what do you think you would find that is different from what is in your own heart? Ooh, that’s a tough one because I don’t feel like I have an enemy. But, I bet I would find the same thing that is in my heart, but just not the loving feeling towards me. Their happiness is probably just reserved for someone else. 76. What do you love most about yourself? That I am not afraid to try…just about anything. My hunger is for experiencing new things and it is was I thrive off of. 77. Where would you most like to go and why? At the moment, I am uber-obsessed with going to Africa . I have a fantasy of learning an African dance, going on a safari and riding an elephant. 78. Is it more important to do what you love or to Love what you are doing? Trick question! Though I believe in thinking positively about whatever you are doing in your life, I also think that taking your passion and turning it into a career is life changing! So, by a thick, wavy hair, it is more important do what you love. 79. What do you imagine yourself doing ten years from now? Having a simple life with the freedom to live and travel where I wish. 80. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget? When I was competing to have a television show on Oprah’s Own Network, the support I got from the most unexpected people was overwhelming. I will never forget how they rooted, voted and spread the word for me. 81. What is your happiest childhood memory? What makes it so special? I believe it’s the same answer as question #60: 60. What is your most beloved childhood memory? I have a fond memory of sitting at my grandmothers kitchen table and “helping” her to make homemade pasta . Growing up in a loud and mostly chaotic Italian family, this memory captures a rare peaceful time. Answering this question has made me realize that I do regret not telling my grandmother how much I loved her (see #57) and now I am forced to relive the beautiful memories I have (#59). 82. Do you own your things or do your things own you? A little bit of both, but I am consistently working on simplifying my life so that they don’t own me. Many years ago I thought my existence should be all about acquiring more. But, have now realized that with that “more” comes more responsibility, more debt and more stress. Now I actively pursue…less. 83. Would you rather lose all of your old memories or never be able to make new ones? I would rather lose all of my old memories, though the thought of not remembering my grandmother truly breaks my heart. But, because so much of my life is about creating experiences that I can share with others, I’m not sure that I would be happy without being able to make new memories. 84. How do you deal with someone in a position of power who wants you to fail? Prove them wrong. 85. What do you have that you cannot live without? If we are talking deep here, then I couldn’t live without happiness and that comes in the form of friends, spirituality, love, learning, etc. If I am being on the shallow side, I would say eating out! Happy butterflies flutter in my tummy whenever I am going to have a meal at a new restaurant. 86. When you close your eyes what do you see? Okay, I actually had to close my eyes to answer this one. Unfortunately, I see all the current and future days events unfolding like rapid-fire at the shooting range. But, more importantly, what I want to see is the serenity of the present moment. 87. What sustains you on a daily basis? The thought that I could have a new experience, learn something or inspire someone. And butternut squash risotto. 88. What are your top five personal values? Gratitude. Honesty. Simplicity. Experience. Inspiration. 89. Why must you love someone enough to let them go? Because when you truly love someone you want them to be happy and sometimes that means without you. 90. of the thought provoking questions: Do you ever celebrate the green lights? I just celebrated on my way home from the market. I opted to take the side streets instead of the freeway during commute traffic, which was a total crap shoot. I hit every green light on the way for five miles, I was practically high-fiving myself. And my lemon sorbet was happy too! 91. What personal prisons have you built out of fears? I vowed many years ago that I was not going to let fear hold me back from accomplishing goals. Which I have been mostly successful at doing. With that said, the one area I have a difficult time with is not letting fear hold me back from truly loving deeply. Call me crazy, but I will jump out of a plane, rappel into a cave & swim with stingrays , but saying “I Love You” scares the crap out of me. Yes…I probably need massive amounts of therapy. 92 What one thing have you not done that you really want to do? Just one? If I absolutely, positively have to choose I want travel to Africa to go on safari, ride an elephant and learn an African dance. 93. Why are you, you? I am me because of my genetic makeup and my past experiences that created who I am today. Every little nook & cranny of me makes me unique from anyone else. 94. If you haven’t achieved it yet what do you have to lose? The security of owning a successful business. My dream is to simplify my life and travel the world in order to check off EVERYTHING on my bucket list. The trick is going to be trying to figure out how to do it while still owning the restaurant that I love. 95. What three words would you use to describe the last three months of your life? Eventful, rapid, life-changing 96. Is it ever right to do the wrong thing? Is it ever wrong to do the right thing? Yes, if the “right thing” protects someone from being hurt, NOT in the deceitful I-did-something-wrong-but-need-to-protect-my-butt sort of way, but in the way that is sincerely meant to shelter the person from suffering. 97. How would you describe ‘freedom’ in your own words? At this moment freedom translates to simplifying. Not being tied down by possessions, not letting them own me. 98.What is the most important thing you could do right now in your personal life? Let go and succumb to the fact that I can not control the actions of any other person. 99. If you could ask one person, alive or dead, only one question, who would you ask and what would you ask? I would ask my grandmother if she had any regrets in her life. 100. If happiness was the national currency, what kind of work would make you rich? Spending everyday having new experiences, exploring the world, learning, enjoying gastronomical adventures and inspiring others to step out of the box. 101. What is your number one goal for the next six months? To take my writing to the next level, by creating a larger following and having more articles published. 102. Would you ever give up your life to save someone else? I can’t imagine not giving my life up for my young niece who has not had a full life to live yet. 103. Are you happy with yourself? Depends on the day. For the most part, I am proud of myself for all of the things I have accomplished and the person that I am. With that said, there are definitely times when I feel like I should be further along in life and during these times I need to take an inventory of my beliefs. I remember, not too long ago saying “if I only had xxx amount of blog followers” or “if my restaurant was only making xxx amount of money” then I would be happy and once that happened the bar was just set higher with no reward. The trick in my life has been learning how to set goals, achieve them, revel in the success and create new goals while still being grateful for what I have done. 104. What is the meaning of ‘peace’ to you? Living in the present moment and being happy about the things I am doing in that moment. 105. What are three moral rules you will never break? This has been the hardest question for me to answer because the word NEVER is so strong and I can not foretell my state of mind in the future. Will I NEVER lie or NEVER cheat or NEVER break the law? The best I can come up with is…I don’t know.  Ok. I can say with a strong conviction that the moral rules I would never break are homicide or incest. 106. What does it mean to allow another person to truly love you? That you have to truly love yourself and let go of all of your insecurities about being hurt by that person. Working on it… 107. Who or what do you think of when you think of love? My little niece who is so sweet and innocent that you feel such a deep, unconditional love for that is never questioned. 108. If your life was a novel, what would be the title and how would your story end? The title would be “Seen it. Done it. Ate it.” It would end with me in a hammock on a tropical beach reading the story of my life to teach young children that they have the opportunity to do anything. 109. What would you not give up for $1,000,000 in cash? My dignity. I wouldn’t do anything that was disrespectful to myself or that would intentionally hurt others. But, pretty much everything else is fair game! 110. T hought provoking questions: When do you feel most like yourself? When I am being creative, whether it be a new experience, recipe or art project. I enjoy how the concentration forces you to be in the present moment and the satisfaction of accomplishment. 111. When you help someone do you ever think, “What’s in it for me?” I would be lying if I said that I NEVER have asked, “how will this benefit me”. Being in the restaurant business, there are times when we are giving donations, not only to support the cause, but to also get exposure for potential new customers. Though, when it comes to personally helping individual people it is usually a selfless act. 112. What is your greatest challenge? To control my mind from obsessing about things I have no control over and continuing to stay present. Beyond that, mastering the perfect souffle is pretty darn difficult too. 113. How do you know when it’s time to continue holding on or time to let go? I listen to my intuition, take note of my general moods each day and analyze what I am eating. When I have a prolonged uneasy feeling in my tummy, am unhappy/indifferent more that 25% of the time or if I am eating when I am not hungry, it is time to let go. 114. How do you define success? Living a life that is filled with happiness, new experiences, good food and nurturing relationships. I have given up the myth of “monetary happiness” a long time ago, but do want to live modestly, comfortable and out of debt. 115. If someone could tell you the exact day and time you are going to die, would you want them to tell you? No, because I wouldn’t want to be constantly thinking of that day, which may affect the happiness of the days leading up to it. Besides, my whole life is about living each day to the fullest with no regrets and that’s what I intend to do no matter when I may kick the bucket. 116. If I could grant you one wish what would you wish for? That I could spend the rest of my life inspiring others to have new experiences, helping them step out of the box and learn something new. 117. What have you read online recently that inspired you? A blog about a terminally ill teenager, Alice Pyne , who created a bucket list as a way to document her precious time with family and friends. In the process she and her sister are raising thousands of dollars for cancer research and getting hundreds of people to sign up for bone marrow donation. She is the epitome of inspiration. 118. Why do religions that advocate unity divide the human race? Because religions have rules to abide by and rules do not advocate unity. 119. If you could live one day of your life over again, what day would you choose? The day I got married. It would be phenomenal to once again have all my family and friends together to celebrate with love, the funky chicken, free-flowing bubbly and lots of cake! 120. What can money not buy? I read this somewhere and thought it was the perfect answer: “money can buy a house, but it can’t buy a home.” 121. If you left this life tomorrow, how would you be remembered? As an honest, sweet woman who lived her life outside of the box. 122. Beyond the titles that others have given you, who are you? Beyond daughter, wife, sister and aunt, I am a caring, adventurous, motivated being. Sometimes a little crazy, but that’s a different story. 123. If you could live the next 24 hours and then erase it and start over just once, what would you do? I can not divulge, nor condone such crazy behavior. I have a reputation to uphold 😉 124. Is it possible to know the truth without challenging it first? Even though it is human nature to question the truth, I do believe it’s possible to know without challenging it. Simply by accepting. 125. What word best describes the way you’ve spent the last month of your life? Discovery. Discovering things about people close to me, life in general and new adventures. 126. What makes everyone smile? When someone smiles at them first. Try it! 127. What do you owe yourself? To love myself enough to treat me with respect. To talk to myself as if I were talking to my best friend. To be my own best friend. 128. What would your ‘priceless’ Mastercard-style commercial be? Airplane ticket around the world $4562, hotels $2857, snacking on ethnic food $2238, memories from the trip of a lifetime…priceless! 129. Can you think of a time when impossible became possible? Tough question for a person who believes that anything is possible. I am amazed everyday by what people and nature are able to accomplish; we can throw a seed into the ground and watch it grow, get wi-fi 30,000 feet up in the air and launch into space. So, even though I might not be the one accomplishing the goal, someone can…and will. 130. Thought provoking questions: Why do you matter? I matter to my mother as a daughter, I matter to my husband as a wife and to my nieces as an aunt. I matter because I spend time trying to enhance the lives others. 131. How have you changed in the last five years? I have learned what makes me happy, to be calm and passionate. In the next five years, I hope to perfect doing what makes me happy, being calm and passionate. 132. What are you sure of in your life? I am certain that I will feel sadness, happiness, pain, joy and fear. I am also sure that I will die. Otherwise, life is totally unpredictable which is what makes it one big adventure! 133. When you think of ‘home,’ what, specifically, do you think of? Large family dinners, games being played by the fire, security and lots of laughter. 134. What’s the difference between settling for things and accepting the way things are? Settling is what you do when you think that you do not deserve better than what you have, whereas, accepting is deciding to be content and happy with where you are at the moment. Don’t ever settle! You do deserve more! 135. How many of your friends would you trust with your life? That totally depends on the circumstance. Trust to jump in front of a car to save my life or trust that they are not going to poison me for a million bucks? Probably…two. Ooh. That’s a little depressing. 136. What’s your definition of heaven? Sitting atop marshmallow clouds, eating a large Italian meal (without gaining an ounce) with all of my loved ones and surrounded by pure happiness. 137. What is your most prized possession? My body. Not, in a vain way…really…I have cellulite too. It’s just that without the strength of my body I would not be able to achieve all the goals that I want to. It has become way more important to nourish and treat my body with loving care so it will sustain me for a very long time to come (& bungee jumping). 138. How would you describe yourself in one sentence? An honest, curious woman who never wants to stop learning or having new experiences. 139. What stands between you and happiness? Only me and my choice. I believe that you choose happiness by the way that you look at life. For the most part, when I am unhappy it is because I chose to be that day. Choosing happy today 🙂 140. What makes a person beautiful? I think everyone has some beautiful quality to them. It could be internal or external, sometimes both. For me, what I find most beautiful in a person is someone who is being authentic to who they are. In other words, owning themselves and making no excuses about it. 141. Is there ever a time when giving up makes sense? Yes, when the goal is not worth the pain you endure, essentially causing you more harm than good. 142. What makes you proud? Anytime someone, including myself, achieves a dream. 143. How do you find the strength to do what you know in your heart is right? I believe that comes with trusting in yourself and knowing that you recognize right from wrong. Sometimes it is still freakin’ hard, but knowing you are doing what is right it is worth the discomfort. 144. Where do you find peace? I find peace in the present moment, not thinking about the past or the future. Also, as I sink my toes in the sand while watching the waves crash at the ocean. 145. When have you worked hard and loved every minute of it? During the first two weeks of owning our restaurant, Sugo Trattoria . I specifically remember falling into bed feeling as if every part of my body had been drained…especially my brain. But, it was also exhilarating, liberating and empowering. When a dream is coming true, the work seems to take a back seat to the excitement. 146. How short would your life have to be before you would start living differently today? I love this question because we usually put off our dreams until “later” thinking that we have more time. In general, I am an active dream achiever, but if I had only a year to live I would put my goals into super highspeed. My problem is that I have so much ambitious and there are not enough hours in the day! 147. Is it better to have loved and lost or to have never loved at all? Absolutely, to have loved and lost. I can’t imagine going through life never having loved. 148. What would you do if you made a mistake and somebody died? Massive amounts of therapy! I can’t even imagine how you could begin to overcome such a tragic situation, while still being respectful to the mourning family of the deceased. I hope that I would have the strength to do what is necessary to pay for my mistake as well as heal in order to feel happiness again. 149. Who do you trust and why? This is such a broad question and I believe we just answered the more narrowed version last week with question #135 – How many people do you trust with your life? “That totally depends on the circumstance. Trust to jump in front of a car to save my life or trust that they are not going to poison me for a million bucks? Probably…two. Ooh. That’s a little depressing.” I trust different people, for different reasons, with different information. 150. Thought provoking questions: If you were forced to eliminate every physical possession from your life with the exception of what could fit into a single backpack, what would you put in it? My Iphone – loaded with all my photos and favorite music My Grandmothers wedding band – it was given to me to wear with my wedding ring and it is precious My Engagement Ring – because my husband picked it out himself and it reminds me of how special it is when you find someone you want to marry Greeting Cards – all the memorable, sweet cards my husband and family ever gave me Poems – the poems, written on scrap paper, by my stepfather who creates one for every holiday My Laptop – it holds all my memorable photos, future business ideas, bucket list goals and books I have started to write 151. When does silence convey more meaning than words? There are many times in life where silent actions mean way more than words. Especially when somebody’s words can not be trusted anymore. 152. How do you spend the majority of your free time? Blogging at the local coffee shop, finding serenity through yoga, trying new restaurants with friends and drinking jammy red wines at the wine bar. 153. Who do you think of first when you think of success? Oprah. Not because she is extremely wealthy, but because she has managed to make a fantastic living doing what she loves, has helped thousands of people along the way and is happy. 154. What did you want to be when you grew up? There were so many different things over the years; psychologist, actress, graphic designer, radio dj, real estate mogul. Now if someone asks me “what do you want to be”? I simply say “happy”. 155. How will today matter in five years from now? What I do today is a stepping stone to five years from now. It is part of the path to my future even though I may not know where it leads. 156. How have you helped someone else recently? As I am writing this, I am sitting in the emergency room waiting for a friend who severely cut her hand. She was scared about getting stitches for the first time and I didn’t want her to be alone. But, I couldn’t look at the cut…gross! 157. What is your greatest skill? The ability to stay motivated or finding a bargain on…anything! 158. Do you see to believe or believe to see? Unless it is a well known fact, I have to see it to believe it. 159. How are you pursuing your dreams right now? Every day at my restaurant I put in 110% to make it better, concentrating on marketing, making creative specials and nurturing the staff. Every night I diligently work on my blog in order to build up readership. I am not one who lacks motivation, I lack limits. 160. What’s the next big step you need to take? To plan a trip around the world. This, of course, is a several step process. I am currently concentrating on the first, which is setting up my restaurant to be run remotely. Some would say it’s “impossible”, but they don’t know me very well. 161. If today was the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today? Of course not, I wouldn’t be working. With that said, what I am doing today is not in vain, it is a step in my path to conquer my dreams. Everyday I try to make the choices in my life by asking myself, “will this simplify my life, get me closer to my goals, inspire someone or bring happiness”. The answer leads the way. 162. If today was the last day of your life, who would you call and what would you tell them? My mom: “I felt a sense of security knowing your unconditional love. Know that I have had an adventurous and full life, no regrets. I hope that all the memories we have shared will bring you joy and you realize that even though I am not here, I am with you.” My husband: “I loved you the best way I knew how, but I wish I could have done better. I should have held you longer and said ‘I love you’ more. The experiences we have shared have been some of my most cherished. I hope you think of me every time you eat something bizarre, have a new adventure or enjoy a nice bottle of Zinfandel. Never forget me, but also find happiness with someone who supports and loves you like you deserve.” My best girlfriend: “Thank you for always telling me like it is instead of just telling me what I want to hear. That is true friendship. We have been through so much together and I will never forget your support. I would be looking down on you sending you angels of happiness for you and your girls.” Okay…now sobbing like a baby… 163. Who do you dream about? Brad Pitt in Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Actually, I don’t dream too often and when I do it is loosely related to whatever is on my mind when I go to sleep. I can’t tell you how many times I have woken up in a cold sweat dreaming about a line out the door of my restaurant, trying to cook all the meals by myself and angry customers throwing tomatoes at me. 164. What do you have trouble seeing clearly in your mind? The end of the path. I have trained my mind to be in present moment, so visualizing what I want my long-term future to look like is extremely difficult. 165. What are you looking forward to? My next major travel adventure, which will be to Spain and Morocco. I can’t wait to ride a camel, get a henna tattoo and be engulfed in Spanish cuisine. Right now, I am completely obsessed with the planning of this amazing experience, because it builds the anticipation. 166. What is the number one thing you want to accomplish before you die? To create a lifestyle that allows me the freedom to travel around the world. 167. When is love a weakness? When it is blind. 168. What has been the most terrifying moment of your life thus far? When I was younger I had a serious panic attack that sent me to the emergency room. They hooked me up to machines to monitor my heart and I had a hard time controlling my fear, thinking I was on the verge of death. I am now grateful for this experience because it taught me a huge lesson about controlling stress and anxiety. 169. Who is the strongest person you know? My best girlfriend, who has a full-time job and raises two young girls on her own. She has been through some serious trauma that would have broken most people, but still believes in trusting, love and the pursuit of a happy life. 170. Thought provoking questions: If you could take a single photograph of your life, what would it look like? There would be an oversized picnic table planted in the sand on the beach. My closest family and friends would be seated at it and it would be filled with red wine, fruits, vegetables, Italian dishes and one “unknown” delicacy that everyone was meant to try. 171. Is the reward worth the risk? In most cases, I believe there is no reward without the risk. So, the answer is “yes”. 172. For you personally, what makes today worth living? What made today worth living is the cappuccino at the local coffee shop, finding the perfect pair of jeans, sneaking off midday to the best Happy Hour ever and a quiet night at home catching up on all my Tivo’d programs. 173. What have you done in the last year that makes you proud? I am so proud that our restaurants sales have increased by over 25%. It has definitely been a labor of love. I am also proud of the incline in readership to my blog . Both instances have proved that passion perseveres. 174. What did you learn recently that changed the way you live? That you can’t trust anyone 100%. Maybe you are all quicker learners than me, but I did believe in trusting all people. Though, I do still believe in trusting until you are proven untrustworthy, I am cautious with who I share my private life with. You would think that is a bad thing, but on the contrary it made me stronger to rely on my own intuition. 175. What is your fondest memory from the past three years? The day my niece was born, I was ecstatic for my brother and sister-in-law to finally have all their dreams come true. 176. What are the primary components of a happy life? Presence, a positive attitude, the “half is glass full” outlook, surrounding yourself with like-minded people, an attitude of gratitude and simplicity. 177. How would the world be different if you were never born? My mother would never have known what it was to have a daughter, my husband would have never eaten lambs brain and that some people would have never started a bucket list or stepped out of the box. 178. What is your favorite song and why? Eminem – Lose Yourself — Every time I listen to it it makes me believe that I am in charge of my own destiny and I CAN do anything I set my mind to, if I take the opportunities that are presented to me. 179. With the resources you have right now, what can you do to bring yourself closer to your goal? Dedicate myself to taking one step everyday setting up my business to run remotely; staff the right employees, create systems that are easy enough to use for anyone and write down all the recipes. 180. What are your top three priorities? Simplifying my life Setting up my restaurant to run semi-remotely (just enough to allow us to travel the world) Retraining my mind to be more positive 181. Why do we idolize sports players? Because, due to their passion and dedication, they have become leaders in their fields and accomplished things we wish we could. 182. What is the nicest thing someone has ever done for you? When I was in the running to have my own television show on Oprah’s Own Network , my family and friends spent countless hours voting for me over 50,000 times. 183. What do you see when you look into the future? Peace, simplicity, new experiences and the adventure of traveling around the world. 184. What makes you angry? Why? I believe that being angry is a choice, so I try not to do it too often. With that said, this concept severely challenges me when people are mean for absolutely no other reason than they are unhappy people. 185. What is the most valuable life lesson you learned from your parents? That there is no substitute for hard work. They taught me to not just expect good fortune, but to work for it. 186. What does love feel like? Love, for me, is when in your heart you want nothing more than that person to be happy, even at the expense of your own happiness. Also, when you feel a sense of mutual trust, respect and a connection that goes way deeper than those of acquaintances. 187. What are your favorite simple pleasures? Puppy breath, cappuccinos in the morning, sand in my toes, eating tiramisu for breakfast, trying something new, happy hours and cuddling with the warm laundry. 188. If you could go back in time and tell a younger version of yourself one thing, what would you tell? Stop worrying about the stuff that is not important in the grand scheme of life. I spent way too much of my precious time concerned about how others felt about me and fretting over things in the future that probably would never happen. Life has been so much easier since letting go. 189. What do you do to deliberately impress others? For the most part, the only person that I now try to impress is myself. I am consistently pushing my life to the limits, continue to learn, take opportunities when they present themselves and have created a life filled with everyday adventure. There have been times when I want to pat myself on the back for a job well done. And that’s a great feeling. 190. of the thought provoking questions:What will you never do? I have always said, “never say never”, because circumstances are ever-changing. 191. Excluding romantic relationships, who do you love? My family, friends and myself. 192. What is your earliest childhood memory? My earliest childhood memory is of an Easter egg hunt where I won a big chocolate bunny. 193. What book has had the greatest influence on your life? What Happy People Know by Dan Baker From Panic to Power by Lucinda Bassett A New Earth by Eckhard Tolle 194. What three questions do you wish you knew the answers to? Is there a higher power and in what form? Will there ever be a cure for cancer? Why do dogs eat grass? 195. What is the greatest peer pressure you’ve ever felt? When I was sixteen, my parents went away for the night and my friends pressured me into have a party that got way out of control. I spent the entire night tending to drunk teens, cleaning up after everyone and being paranoid that my parents would come home early. No fun! 196. What’s the biggest lie you once believed was true? When I was young, I got a splinter in my finger that I could not get out. My neighbor told me that if I left it in there it would turn into a peanut. I believed him for the next five years. 197. In your lifetime, what have you done that hurt someone else? I have definitely said some non-intentional, mindless things that have hurt the people that I care about. This usually ends up making me feel worse than them in the long run. I have also made a couple of boys cry by ending our relationships, but not in a mean-spirited way, just by being honest. Don’t worry, a couple of boys did the same to me. 198. What’s the best part of growing older? Feeling more secure and knowing yourself better. 199. What’s been on your mind most lately? How can I run a successful blog and restaurant at the same time? What steps do I need to take in order to do so. 200. What do you think is worth waiting for? Anything spectacular; true love, a fine meal, an amazing adventure, a first kiss. 201. What chances do you wish you had taken? I wish that after I graduated high school or college that I took a year off to backpack around the world. 202. Where else would you like to live? Why? I do love where I live, but it is my dream to spend every other month in a different country to experience the culture. 203. What motivates you to go to work each day? The thought of creating something deliciously fabulous that my customers will enjoy eating that day. 204. What do you wish you had done differently? Isn’t that close to the same thing as #201? Last night, I do wish I went to bed at 10:00 instead of 12:30. Ouch! Feeling it this morning. 205. What is your greatest strength and your greatest weakness? My greatest strength is my seemingly never-ending motivation, but my greatest weakness is tackling too many goals at once. 206. When was the last time you lied? What did you lie about? The last time I lied was about a month ago when I told my husband about how much I spent on a pair of shoes, they were $40 but I said $30. I don’t even know why, he could really care less how much I spend on shoes, because he knows I’m cheap anyway! 207. What made you smile this week? When my little niece came for a surprise visit at work. It was unexpected, sweet and it immediately brightened my day. 208. What do you do with the majority of your money? Pay bills! I’m assuming they mean what I do with my spare money and most of that goes to eating out or traveling or eating out while traveling 😉 209. What motivates you to be your best? I am constantly challenging myself and setting baby goals. Those goals motivate me everyday. 210. of the thought provoking questions: When was the last time you lost your temper? About what? I usually remain pretty even-tempered. But, the last time I lost it was when an employee lied about needing time off for an “emergency”. When, to find out, she really just wanted a weekend off. I don’t like being lied to. 211. What will you never give up on? Being a dreamer and believer that anything is possible. 212. When you look into the past, what do you miss the most? My grandmother. She was always around cooking her fabulous Italian food, speaking in the cutest broken English and telling us stories of the past. 213. How would you describe the past year of your life in one sentence? My last year has been a learning experience filled with triumphs, new adventures, some failures and lots of hard work! 214. What is the most spontaneous thing you’ve ever done? I went skydiving on a whim. It was a spur of the moment decision that I am so grateful for, or else I would have been scared for weeks until I jumped out of the plane! 215. What makes you uncomfortable? Being at large parties with people I don’t know, talking politics, confrontation and when people argue in front of me. 216. If you had to move 3000 miles away, what one thing would you miss the most? Being able to walk from my restaurant to my moms new deli for a quick visit before work. Just about every morning I make the one block trek over to her place to say “hello” and get a cup of coffee. It is one of those simple events in your day that means a lot. 217. What worries you about the future? That I will not be able to have the freedom to live the life I dream of. 218. What one ‘need’ and one ‘want’ will you strive to achieve in the next twelve months? I need to simplify my life and get my business set up to run more remotely. I want to plan an ‘Around the World’ trip. 219. What life lessons did you have to experience firsthand before you fully understood them? So many. But, one that stands out is death. I would have never been able to fully understand the emotions involved in the passing of a loved one if I did not experience it. 220. Do you like the city or town you live in? Why or why not? I love where I live because it is centrally located between the beach, San Francisco and dozens of vineyards. The only thing I wish is that it was 10 degrees warmer all the time! 221. What’s the best part of being you? That I am the ultimate dreamer who believes that just about anything can become a reality with passion, hard work and persistence. 222. When you look back over the past month, what single moment stands out? A random invitation to go on the Playboy Kandy Kruise . A reader of my blog, and fellow bucket lister, invited me to go on this once-in-a-lifetime cruise. After working through the initial fears of insecurity, I accepted. 223. What do you do to relieve stress? Yoga, hiking, the beach and a glass of jammy red wine. It is a bonus if they all occur in one day. 224. What is your happiest memory? The day I got married. It was so memorable because it is a rare occasion when most of your loved ones are gathered together in celebration. 225. What is your saddest memory? The day my grandmother died. Even though she had lived a full life, I still found it to be so unexpected. It was the first major death I had experienced, so it was extremely tough working through the emotions I had. On the positive side, it has helped me to cope better with every death after hers. 226. What would you like to change (about yourself)? I would like to be a better listener, or rather, a retainer of the information I have heard. I can have a conversation with someone and forget what we talked about ten minutes later, whereas, some people can hear something once and remember it for a lifetime. 227. How many people do you love? Too many to really count. A lot. 228. What’s the best decision you’ve ever made? Years ago I went on a hunt to find my passion. I was trying just about everything because I knew that there would be one thing that I loved so much that I would want to do it for the rest of my life. During the search I realized that the hunt was my passion. I became addicted to having new experiences and this became my passion. 229. What’s your favorite true story that you enjoy sharing with others? Since my blog is all about new experiences and adventures, I have many. But, some of my favorites are swimming with stingrays , rappelling into a cave and eating lambs brain on my anniversary. 230. Right now, at this moment, what do you want most? At this moment, I want to feel content with where I am in life and the direction it is taking. Also, to concentrate on being happy in the present moment, forgetting about the past and not fretting over the future. That’s a lot to tackle! 231. What are you waiting for? How are you writing your life’s story? Though I am waiting to be out of debt, for my blog to be a huge success and to have more freedom to create at my restaurant, I am always actively writing my life’s story. I am consistently setting baby goals in order to achieve the aforementioned. 232. What makes love last? Forgiveness, commitment and communication 233. What good comes from suffering? There is always a lesson to learn through suffering. Most of my suffering has made me stronger in order to deal with the situation when and if it should happen again. 234. What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in the last year? That trusting yourself is more important than trusting anyone else. 235. Based on you current daily actions and routines, where would you expect to be in five years? Still owning Sugo Trattoria , but with more freedom to travel, having a line of some type of food product (& a cookbook), continued growth with my blog , dozens of checks off my bucket list and being paid to write about food, travel & new experiences. 236. What was your last major accomplishment? As far as my restaurant goes, receiving a Michelin Recommendation was the last major accomplishment. Now it’s time to start working for the coveted Michelin star. With my blog, I am proud that my Alexa rating has dropped from 1.2 million to 500,000 in the past month. (Alexa ranks blogs by popularity). Both of these accomplishments have taken a lot of work. 237. Through all of life’s twists and turns who has been there for you? My husband, my mom or my best girlfriend. Most of the time, all three. 238. What or who has been distracting you? Work!! We have been extremely busy and shorthanded, so I am distracted by covering shifts and training new employees. A few more weeks and I will be back on the motivation track! 239. What are you looking forward to in the upcoming week? Relaxing in Arizona . Every few months my husband and I alternate vacationing in Arizona . This week is my turn! I am looking forward to enjoying the sun, seeing old friends and exploring the state. 240. Who is your mentor and what have you learned from them? I don’t have just one, but everybody who has acquired something that I want is my mentor. There are several restaurant owners, bloggers, wives and friends who I learn from on a daily basis. 241. What are you uncertain about? Everything. Is there anything really certain about life? That’s what makes life so amazing, that it is unexpected. The one thing that I am pretty sure about is that I will always be a dreamer who has a passion for new experiences. 242. What do you think about when you lie awake in bed? If I am lucky…nothing! But, most of the time, it involves the tasks I need to accomplish the next day. 243. What’s something most people don’t know about you? Due to my blog, I am pretty much an open book. But, I think most people don’t know that I floss my teeth in the car…EEEWWW….gross! Only when I am alone though 😉 244. When you have a random hour of free time, what do you usually do? Either work on my travel blog , cook something or try anything new. 245. What makes you weird? I think I answered this question best in my blog post “You Do You…and Let Me Do Me.” More often than not, I will forgo the mani/pedi combo to hike a beach trail at Point Reyes with hopes of seeing the spout of an emerging whale. I’d rather talk hashtags (read the Twitter handbook), Iphone apps and investments than the latest fashion. I am a self-professed computer nerd (minus the bow-tie & glasses) and can easily stay home on a Saturday night with a glass of jammy red wine to work on my website, surf the internet or plan my next adventure. I would rather have any new experience than lay stagnant in monotony. If I had to choose between shopping and skydiving, the later would win every time. Big diamonds and shiny jewels don’t impress me, because I know that carats in no way equate to true love. I believe that being content is always nice, but being happy is far superior (there is a difference). Even though I love to strap-on a pair of 4” heels for a night on the town, I think it’s just as sexy wearing a ribbed tank, my favorite jeans and flip-flops. I want to take advantage of all that life has to offer, even if it means eating lambs tongue or making a complete jackass out of myself. 246. If you could relive yesterday what would you do differently? Actually nothing. Yesterday was a great day. I am on vacation in Arizona and started my day eating Chambord French toast with Peter, went shopping, met a girlfriend for happy hour, drove through the streets at night with the windows down because it was 90 degrees, watched a movie and still got to sleep early. Can I just relive it the same way? 247. What do you do over and over again that you hate doing? Cleaning the house. I always feel like it’s a waste of time because it just gets dirty again. Everyone tells me to get a house cleaner, but I am too darn cheap! 248. Would you rather your child be less attractive and extremely intelligent or extremely attractive and less intelligent? I don’t have children, but if I did I would want them to be extremely intelligent. In my opinion, there is nothing like the feeling of accomplishing something because of your intellect. 249. What white lies do you often tell? Mostly to my husband about the money I spend on clothes. I am not sure why. He could care less because he knows I am cheap and would never overspend. 250. of the thought provoking questions: What is the biggest change you have made in your life in the last year? We have stabilized our bills, rented our investment properties and hired enough employees at the restaurant so we are not covering as many shifts. This is all in an effort to have more freedom to travel and experience different cultures. 251. What do you understand today about your life that you did not understand a year ago? That I am a strong woman who can be hit with hard circumstances and still survive with my dignity in tact. 252. Whose life have you had the greatest impact on? My mothers, because we are so close in age that we have become friends and confidants. 253. What did life teach you yesterday? It didn’t teach me, but reconfirmed that: I love to travel, I am independent, I can be a good friend and killing people with kindness can change a persons foul mood. 254. Who impresses you? Everyone that has stepped out of the box to do something that I have not. 255. What have you done that you are not proud of? Several years ago I got caught up in fitting in with “the girls” and joined in a conversation where they were talking badly about someone we didn’t even know. The girl’s friend heard us, it caused a small scene and I was disappointed in myself for a long time for needlessly hurting someones feelings. But, it was also a huge lesson on why you shouldn’t judge people. 256. When should you reveal a secret that you promised you wouldn’t reveal? When the secret would cause serious harm to a loved one by not revealing it. 257. How would you spend your ideal day? It would start with waking up to a cappuccino and crunchy, berry scone. Then, I would take a road trip to explore the culture of a new town and accomplish a bucket list adventure while I was there. I would then dine at a memorable restaurant that serves creative food and a fabulously jammy red wine. Great music would be playing on the radio the entire way back home and I would jump into a bed with freshly washed sheets, an inspirational movie and popcorn. 258. What is the one primary quality you look for in a significant other? Happiness. The person must be generally happy about life. 259. What do you admire most about your mother and father? I admire that my mother has opened over seven successful restaurants by shear will and hard, back breaking work. She is never afraid of getting in there and getting dirty. I admire my dad for his attention to detail and patience when it comes to the tasks he does. You always know that anything he has a hand in will be completed to perfection. 260. What is the best advice you have ever received? To never take advice from anyone who has not aquired the life that you want. 261. If you could live forever, would you want to? Why? Absolutely! Because every day is a learning experience and with more days under my belt I feel that I could learn to be my best self in order to help others. 262. If you had to be someone else for one day, who would you be and why? Oprah. I would like to have her level of influence and connections for a day so I could spend it moving mountains to help people. 263. What positive changes have you made in your life recently? I have made a decision to only read inspirational books, to seek wisdom from the friends I choose and to focus only on the facts of my life instead of creating scenarios based on fictional thoughts in my head. I also have been more concentrated in my yoga practice . 264. Who makes you feel good about yourself? Myself. Even though my friends, husband, and family all make me feel good about myself at times, I realize that it is ultimately me who is in charge of speaking positively to myself. 265. What is your biggest regret? That I did not take a year off after college to experience the world. It makes it harder with more responsibility in our lives. But, it is definitely not impossible! 266. Which one of your responsibilities do you wish you could get rid of? Oh jeez…just one? I would like to get rid of the bookkeeping portion of my restaurant . For some reason, seeing a stack of bills and doing payroll gives me anxiety, even when we are doing very well. 267. What’s something you don’t like to do that you are still really good at? Designing logos. I was a graphic designer many years ago, so I am occasionally asked to design business logos. Summing up an entire business in one little logo is stressful on my brain. 268. What type of person angers you the most? Someone who thinks that they are always right, even when they are blatantly wrong. Just admit it. 269. What is missing in your life? A sense of stability. Things are always changing rapidly in my life, which, for the most part, I love. But, there are definitely times when I would like to make a plan without having the fear that someone won’t show up to work that day. 270. What is your most striking physical attribute? Ooh! This question really toys with a woman’s body image issues. I feel fortunate that I am naturally thin. 271. What has fear of failure stopped you from doing? I vowed many years ago to not let fear stop me from following my dreams. With that said, there have been many times I have had to push, shove and kick through the fear to get to the other side. 272. Who would you like to please the most? Myself. That sounds selfish, but let me explain. I don’t think you should spend your life trying to please others, as long as you are a good-natured person with good intentions. And by pleasing yourself, you can be the best you possible. 273. If you could go back in time and change things, what would you change about the week that just passed? I would have not made my return flight from Las Vegas so early in the morning 😉 274. When you meet someone for the very first time what do you want them to think about you? That I am an interesting, sweet girl who lives her life by stepping out of the box. 275. Who would you like to forgive? I try to not hold grudges because holding on to hurt only negatively affects my life. Even if someone does not deserve forgiveness, I forgive because I deserve to have the freedom from my mind. 276. At what point during the last five years have you felt lost and alone? About a year ago there was a point when I questioned whether I could trust anyone around me or, for that matter, if anyone was a truly honest person. At that time, I felt like a had a severe misunderstanding about what life was about. Though, because of that time, I now know that I just need to trust myself to make the right decisions when I am faced with any situation. 277. What is one opportunity you believe you missed out on when you were younger? Same as #265 – That I did not take a year off after college to experience the world. It makes it harder with the more responsibility in our lives. But, it is definitely not impossible! 278. What do you want more of in your life? Uncontrollable laughter. I love it when something is so pee-your-pants funny that you can not control your laughter. 279. What do you want less of in your life? To be surrounded by toxic people. I have many wonderful people in my life, but, there are a few who suck my spirit dry. 280. Who depends on you? My husband, my employees, my family and my friends. 281. Who has had the greatest impact on your life? It is too difficult to say since so many people have impacted me in different ways; my mother has taught me to have a work ethic, my husband showed me the importance of completing a task to the best of your ability instead of half-fasting it, my dad gave me a love of exploring, etc. Though, I will say that finally being able to control my anxiety has had the GREATEST impact on my life and that was all about me saying enough was enough and working so hard for years to change my thought patterns. It is still a work in progress, but life has never been happier. 282. Are you happy with where you are in your life? Why? Yes, because I have worked my tail off to get where I am at. Our restaurant is successful, my blog is on the rise, my marriage is stable, I am fortunate enough to have amazing adventures, my spirituality is stronger and we live a comfortable life. I am extremely grateful. 283. In one year from today, how do you think your life will be different? I foresee more freedom to travel the world, increased sales at our restaurant and a million blog readers 😉 284. How have you sabotaged yourself in the past five years? I spent too much time obsessing about things that I had no control over. 285. Other than money, what else have you gained from your current job? So much. A sense of pride and ownership. Strong friendships. Increased strength of character. Boosted level of skill. 286. Whom do you secretly envy? Why? 80% of my envious feelings are related to people who have the ability to travel freely. The remaining 20% is split up between popular celebrity chefs, successful travel bloggers, passionate dreamers and, occasionally, a really hot girl that catches the husbands eye 😉 287. In twenty years, what do you want to remember? The best days with my grandmother, my wedding day, the beautiful countries I have visited and amazing adventures I have had 288. What are you most excited about in your life right now – today? The fact that we have started to etch some significant time to travel, our restaurant has surpassed my initial goals and I have just received my first press pass to an event. 289. What experience from this past year do you appreciate the most? I appreciate that I was able to share the amazing adventure of swimming with stingrays with my husband while we were traveling to Grand Cayman. Need some travel inspiration? Read these top 200 travel quotes and the ultimate Travel Bucket List for some insipiration. 290. What is the most enjoyable thing your family has done together in the last three years? We all were at the hospital when my niece was born. My brother and his wife wanted to be parents so badly that it made the birth of their first child so precious. 291. How many hours of television do you watch in a week? A month? A year? I hate to admit that the television is always on when I am home for background noise. Though, most of the time i am on my computer and not paying attention. I watch about 15-20 hours per week, mostly reality shows. I know…it’s bad…so bad, it’s good! 292. What is the biggest obstacle that stands in your way right now? I am always actively working towards my goals and believe that they are achievable, But, would benefit from more time. I know what steps I need to be taking, I just need to set aside the time to take them. 293. What do you sometimes pretend you understand that you really don’t? I think I have hit that age that if I don’t understand something I just ask. But, there are times when people are talking about sports or politics and I just nod my head because I don’t follow them too closely. 294. What do you like most about your job? What do you dislike most about your job? I love every aspect of my job that promotes creativity. This relates mostly to creating new recipes. I don’t love managing employees or doing the payroll. 295. What’s something new you recently learned about yourself? After trying several different types of exercise I realized that I love yoga. Prior, I had always thought it would be way too slow for a fast-paced girl like me. But, I now know that it is exactly what I need to balance my speedy life! 296. In one sentence, how would you describe your relationship with your mother? A friendship that is based on a mutual respect and a two-sided unconditional love. 297. What was the most defining moment in your life during this past year? One statement: “I will seek wisdom”. This was stated in a book I was reading and referred to surrounding yourself with people who teach and inspire you. And that when you are in the constant presence of toxic people your personality, in some ways, emulates these people. Case in point, does your spouse act differently when they are with their girl/guy friends? After taking an inventory, I believe this to be true and I took action, which is not so easy when some of the people closest to you are the ones hindering your growth. I have always preached that you should only take advice from people who have acquired what you want, but this took it one step further. 298. What’s the number one change you need to make in your life in the next twelve months? Continue to train my mind to be present, positive and filled with gratitude. I know, corny. But, it works! 299. What makes you feel secure? Trusting myself to know that I can handle any situation that presents itself. 300. of the thought provoking questions: What is your favorite sound? The waves crashing at the ocean, birds chirping in the morning and childrens laughter. 301. What are the top three qualities you look for in a friend? Honesty (even when it hurts), humble nature and compatibility. Though I initially love it when friends always stick up for you, I respect it when they tell you when you are wrong. 302. What simple gesture have you recently witnessed that renewed your hope in humanity? I feel a renewed hope in humanity anytime someone sincerely says “I’m Sorry”. 303. What is your favorite smell? Wild mushrooms sautéing, neighborhood BBQs roaring, the crisp air before it snows and Dolce & Gabanas Light Blue perfume. 304. What recent memory makes you smile the most? When I was at the pumpkin patch with my niece and she looked up at me with puppy-dog eyes because she wanted to hold my hand. Melts my heart. 305. In one word, how would you describe your childhood? Short 306. What celebrities do you admire? Why? Oprah, because she is an inspiration for progression and living your best life. 307. What is the number one motivator in your life right now? Myself and my dreams. 308. What music do you listen to to lift your spirits when you’re feeling down? Depends on why I am feeling down ;). Weird, but I mostly like to listen to Eminem when I feel like I need a motivational kick in the pants. 309. If I gave you $1000 and told you that you had to spend it today, what would you buy? A plane ticket to London and Spain. 310. What was the last thing that made you laugh out loud? I farted. Out loud. I’m laughing just writing that. My husband of 14 years has NEVER heard me fart, because I don’t & if I did they would smell like roses :). But, it happened while we were watching TV and we both were laughing until the point of tears. He threatened to put it in his Facebook status, but I threatened his life! 311. What is your biggest pet peeve? When people defend themselves when they know they are wrong. Chicks dig it when you admit you are wrong 😉 312. Who was the last person you said “I love you” to? My husband 313. What is your biggest phobia? Flying. Even though I have vowed to never let it hinder me traveling the world, it is painful every time I fly! Isn’t there a magic pill by now? 314. What are some recent compliments you’ve received? I was told that someone loved my blog , thought I was way younger than I am and that the dish I cooked was spectacular. Not all in the same day…damn. 315. How many friends do you have in real life that you talk to regularly? Four. It’s not quantity, it’s quality 🙂 316. How much money per month is enough for you to live comfortably? Wow. I think this is the first question I feel uncomfortable answering. I’ll just say that the answer is probably a lot more than others because we own rental properties that we have to fork out money for. If you took mortgages out of the picture, $5,000 a month would be really good. 317. When was your first impression of someone totally wrong? I don’t know if it was the first, but when we were in Belize , my first impression of our tour guide was COMPLETELY off because he had neck tattoos and piercings. He turned out to be the nicest of everyone we met, shame on me! 318.How many hours a week do you spend online? Crap…way to much! Definitely more than watching TV. Maybe 30, conservatively. But, I would like to defend myself by saying that most of the time it for blogging, marketing, networking, business and researching. It is rare that I will be randomly surfing. 319. What do you love to do? Hike, dine at great restaurants, travel, laugh, have new experiences, plan adventures, blog 320. What specific character trait do you want to be known for? Sincerity 321. Are you more like your mom or your dad? In what way? Actually a lot of both, but my mom leads by a hair because I was raised with her. I have her crazy work ethic, love of anything Italian and definitely exhibit similar mannerisms. 322. What is the number one quality that makes someone a good leader? Being respected, yet likable 323. What bad habits do you want to break? I have this terrible habit of waiting for my husband to say “Hello” first when he comes home from work, instead of just saying “Hi, honey, how was your day?” I am chalking it up as coming from a dysfunctional family where you never knew what to expect when you came home, so I was always waiting to let the tone be set by someone else. Trying hard to break it. 324. What is your favorite place on Earth? Out of all the places I have been, I would say that Venice, Italy was love at first sight. I also adore any warm, blue beach. But, there are hundreds of places I have yet to visit 😉 325. What do you love to practice? What I preach 😉 326. What questions do you often ask yourself? Is this intuition talking or fear? Is what you are doing right now making you happy? Is chocolate really that bad for you? 327. What are you an expert at? Depends on who you ask. We are all experts to someone, depending on the knowledge level of the person asking. 328. How would an extra $1000 a month change your life? It would pay one of my investment properties mortgage, which would be a huge relief. 329. What things in life should always be free? Water, advice and love 330. What is your favorite time of the year? Easily summer. I am always cold, so winter is a hard season for me. Though, I do enjoy cuddling on the couch during the cold weather. 331. What is something you have always wanted since you were a kid? I always wanted to live on a farm with one of each animal. But, now I can’t do that until I find someone to take care of them all. I don’t want to shovel poop at 4:00am. 332. What is the most recent dream you remember having while sleeping? I just had a dream that my husband was telling me his days itinerary. He was going to play basketball for an hour, then going to make homemade sausage with his friend, then they were going to play basketball again, then go back to the kitchen to make some cured meat. Weird, because he doesn’t play basketball. 333. What confuses you? Why when many men cheat they blame it on “the way men are wired”. Unless, you are living in the wild, cheating is a choice. 334. In what way are you your own worst enemy? When I am not careful, I can be an obsessive thinker which leads me on a downward spiral of negative thoughts. Never a good thing! 335. When did you not speak up when you should have? I can’t think of a specific time, but there has been many occasions where I expected people to understand what type of person I was without actually pointing out my attributes. Because, I am more of a “I’ll show you what I can do” sort of girl. 336. What is your favorite quote? History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it. Winston Churchill 337. What is your favorite fictional story? (novel, movie, fairytale, etc.) Cinderella. I love almost any story where a caterpillar turns into a beautiful butterfly. 338. Where or who do you turn to when you need good advice? I turn to my best girlfriend when I need relationship advice and my husband when it is just about anything else. 339. What artistic medium do you use to express yourself? Mostly cooking, but I also enjoy being “Martha Stewart” crafty. 340. Who or what is the greatest enemy of mankind? Negative thinking. 341. What’s something you wish you had done earlier in life? Recognized and made an effort to conquer anxiety 342. What is the closest you have ever come to fearing for your life? Every time i am on a plane 😉 More seriously, When I was younger, I had a panic attack that led me into the emergency room. I felt as if I couldn’t catch my breath and that I was surely going to die. Though, it was terrifying, it was also such a valuable lesson. 343 How do you deal with isolation and loneliness? To be honest, I don’t get lonely too often because I enjoy being by myself. 344. What do you know well enough to teach to others? How to set up a blog, make homemade pasta and create a really cool cork board. 345. What’s a quick decision you once made that changed your life? To buy a rental property right before the recession. Though, I believe that every decision we make creates a new path in our lives. 346. What have you lost interest in recently? Shopping. I used to live for clothes shopping, but now I would rather go to a cool restaurant or sit at a coffee shop and blog. 347.What makes life easier? Flushing toilets, good friends and wine. 348. What was the last thing you furiously argued about with someone? An employee told me that she wasn’t coming to work because we didn’t have any kitchen degreaser at the restaurant and therefore couldn’t do her job. Not a good day 😉 349. What job would you never do no matter how much it paid? Never say never, but almost never: security guard or cleaning grease traps. 350. of the thought provoking questions: What is the number one solution to healing the world? Positive Thinking. 351.

At my restaurant 355. What makes someone a hero? Going above and beyond what is expected from the average human being. 356. When in your life have you been a victim of stereotyping? Just recently I was meeting a repairman at my house during the middle of the day and he made some comments that would insinuate I didn’t work and was watching soap operas all day. I was more than happy to set him straight. 357. When was the last time you felt lucky? That’s a tough one because I feel that hard work and good decisions has been the main reason for the successes in my life. 358.When did you first realize that life is short? When I turned 40 and, more than a few, friends passed away. 359. What is the most insensitive thing a person can do? Betray your trust. 360. What can someone do to grab your attention? Smile without any motive behind it except getting a smile in return 361. What do you usually think about on your drive home from work? Not much considering my drive home is only four blocks 😉 362. What’s one downside of the modern day world? Technology is changing so rapidly that it is stressful to have to keep up. 363. What simple fact do you wish more people understood? Being nice will get you further in life than being mean. 364. If you could do it all over again, would you change anything? I would have never bought rental properties 365.

Some questions are quite complicated, and some questions are deceptively simple but with broad or far reaching implications. We’ve got philosophical questions on human nature and the human condition / the universe and reality / the human mind, consciousness, and intelligence / ethics and morality / society and government / science and technology . It’s a great list of questions to get an intellectually stimulating discussion going and touches on a lot of different areas of philosophy. And while some of the questions might be intriguing to academically trained philosophers, this list of philosophical questions is aimed at a more general audience and is meant to be accessible to everyone. I’ve also put up a printable PDF and an image of all the questions at the bottom of the page. So, have a look, I’m sure you’ll find at least a few philosophical questions that will pique your interest.

But that doesn’t mean we don’t all have our own thoughts, ideas and philosophies. We tend to conceal these thoughts and feelings, thinking that they’re too personal to share and that nobody would be interested in hearing them. An effective way to get to break through superficial conversations and get to know someone else on a much deeper level is by asking personal questions that bring to surface these deeper ponderings. The next time you are unwinding with a colleague or a close friend , try asking them a personal question and see if they’re willing to share. You may find that by giving them an outlet to talk about themselves, they may find it therapeutic . If you pay attention and listen, you’ll also learn more about them, boosting your relationship with them to a deeper level. Sometimes it takes a bit of icebreaking to get to more personal questions.

Some may be considered close to you as a family; they feel like your brother, sister, or cousin. Others you see potential in – maybe with these friendships, you need time to nurture and grow.. In life, friendships are important. They are the people with who you choose to surround yourself. When it comes to family, you get what you are born into. You may or may not get along with your family, and for many people, being with family can be a source of stress. Friends are people who have similar interests as you; you could have met them through school, work , or other activities. Some friends you met when you are young, and then you grow into different people and lose touch, which is a normal part of life. The friendships that you keep helps ease the stress of other aspects of life. Friends can get you through a day of work and a lot of other stressful periods in life. They can help you get through relationships: the start, the middle, and the end. And while friends are great to backboard against for ideas and life advice, if you need someone to talk to about your relationships , you can also seek professional help.

Source: rawpixel.com When it comes to any relationship, the connection and bond grow with time. There is always that desire to get to know each other better or look for ways to bond more. Relationships of any kind go through different growth phases. The people involved will not get to know everything about one another in one day. One of the most powerful and surest ways to get to know someone is by asking questions. One way to help yourself connect easily and effectively with other people is by asking the right questions. This can change your life and also help you to know how to harness each relationship. Asking the perfect questions can be very instrumental in grooming your existing relationships to grow and build new ones. Also, asking the right questions from people is more like a secret weapon, especially in social situations. You can choose to memorize some of your favorites or have them stored up on your phone, and you pull them out whenever the need arises. That way, you will rarely be at a loss for words in your relationships or any gathering you find yourself. However, it is important to consider the person(s) you are having the conversation with, the mood or tone of the conversation, and the goal. This way, you will know which questions to use per time and not ask the wrong questions to throw people off-guard or turn them off. Even in the closest of friendships, there are always still new things to discover about one another. Whether you feel as if you know your friends the way you know yourself or are just getting started, there are likely many questions that you have not asked each other, telling ways to find out facts about the other. In most cases, building effective communication and bonds between friends depend on finding the right questions to ask. You may think you already know so much about your closest friends, but you would be surprised at how much deeper you can still go and the many things you can still learn about one another that you don’t already know- from the serious to the silly things. If you are at dinner, on vacation together, or just hanging out, you can ask your friend’s deep questions that will help you find out about each other.

It's good to have some unconventional deep questions to ask when you want to have a deep and meaningful conversation.

Asking and answering these deep questions can literally result in the involved parties building a solid bond for life. Here are some additional deep questions to ask that differ from the ones listed in the article above: \"If you could give your younger self advice, what would it be?\" \"If you had the chance to redo a particular time in your life, would you take it? If so, what time would you pick and what would you change?\" \"Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? Why or why not?” “What do you fear the most about getting older?” “How far can you go for health and fitness? “What is that best bad decision you have ever taken?” \"Have you ever taken something or someone for granted that you wish you could get back?\" \"Is there a time or event in your life that you wish you would've appreciated more?\" “What is that one thing that you are deeply proud of in your life?” “Have you ever made a decision that changed the entire course of your life? If yes, what was it?” Apart from necessities, what is that one thing that you cannot go a day without? “Is there an opportunity you turned down that you secretly wish you’d have taken?” “What do you hope to have achieved by 50?” The ability to come up with and ask questions is an excellent social skill to have. If you can ask questions, you can keep almost any conversation going. Additionally, studies show that it makes you more likable . Keep in mind that the questions you ask kids will differ from those that you ask adults. If you are talking to children and want to develop questions for kids, be sure to keep the subject matter relatively simple and child-friendly. Kids are extremely creative, so questions like, \"what would your dream house look like?\" or \"if you could have any animal as a pet, what would it be?\" are sure to garner an entertaining answer. What are some deep questions to ask a friend? The questions featured in the list of deep questions in the article above are great questions to ask your friends. That said, the questions you can ask your friends are pretty much endless. As long as they are respectful and aren't crossing any boundaries within the particular friendship, you can diversify the deep questions you ask your friends by asking something personal to that specific person. For example, if they've already answered a question like \"what's your favorite place to travel?\" you can ask a follow-up question about what they like the most about their favorite place to travel. You can also ask deep questions like, \"have you ever experienced something that changed your life rapidly and dramatically?\" or \"who would you say your greatest mentors have been so far in life if you have any?\" No matter how well you know someone, there's always more to learn. Even if your friend is a life-long best friend, asking deep questions can help you uncover more or even give you a new perspective on a specific topic yourself. It is important to be careful with deep questions and best used with someone you have some level of closeness with. This is because some deep questions may be personal and may evoke some deep thoughts or even memories. Of course, if it is someone you are comfortable or free with, asking deep questions will not be a problem; it would, in fact, strengthen the bond that already exists between you. Notwithstanding, it is important not to be pushy when asking questions; always be sensitive, and pay attention to the other person’s body language. If you notice they are not comfortable, then refrain or change the subject. It is important to note that there is a right time and place for deep conversations. Sometimes, they may have been planned, while in some cases, they may happen spontaneously. During a deep conversation, openness on your own part is also essential. If you want the person you are engaging in the discussion to open up to you, you need to do the same thing. Be willing to give your own answers; this way, you create a comfortable, no-judgment zone. Some more deep questions that you can ask are: Looking through your life in its entirety, what would you consider the highlight of your life? What is the biggest change you would like to make in your life? Do you think things would get better if people focused more on going well instead of going wrong? Do you think a life focused on seeking out pleasure and avoiding pain is a good and worthwhile life? What is the reason behind your response? What is that one thing you do not seem to understand about yourself? In the journey of life, to what extent do you think one can shape their own destiny, and how much is down to fate? Which do you think should be considered more important: Doing the right thing or doing things right? Is a ‘wrong’ act okay if nobody finds out about it? Is it possible to always have happiness without sadness? What should I ask in 20 questions? The best set of questions to ask will vary somewhat based on context. Fun, casual questions work well in group settings where you don’t want to be too invasive about someone’s life. You can also ask questions to get to know someone on a deeper level. Here are some ideas for what to ask during a game of 20 Questions: \"If life was a movie, what celebrity would play you?\" \"What's your biggest pet peeve?\" \"What's the craziest thing you've ever done?\" \"What fictional character do you relate to the most?” “What’s the weirdest thing a stranger’s ever said to you?” “Do you have a go-to line when you use dating apps?” “If you could only eat three foods for the rest of your life, what would they be?” “Who’s the hilarious person you know?” “If you absolutely had to repeat one grade in school, which grade would it be?” “Would you say that you keep a lot of secrets?” “Are there any secrets that you keep from your family but not from your friends?” “At what age was your first kiss?” “Do you remember your first love's zodiac sign?” “Would you ever go ghost hunting?” “What’s one of the biggest lessons you’ve learned in life so far?” “As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?” “What’s a skill you’d like to learn?” “What are your favorite movies?” “What are your favorite TV shows?” “What were your favorite subjects in school?” “If you had unlimited financial resources, what would you do with your life?” “What was your first job?” “What are some vacations you’d like to take?” “What’s your typical coffee order?” “Are there any hobbies you had as a kid that you still have now?” “What apps on your phone do you use the most?” If you see a question that you are fond of or that makes you say “this question is great” or “I love this question,” you might remember it and add it to your set of questions to ask during your next game of 20 questions. What is a deep question to ask a guy? Many of the questions in the article above double as great questions to ask a guy, but there is an endless number of ideas out there. Here are some examples of deep questions that you can ask a guy: \"What is your greatest accomplishment in life so far?\" “Do you consider yourself religious or spiritual?” “If you won the lottery today, what would you do with the money?” “What is that one thing that’s happened to you that still makes you smile whenever you remember?” “What is your best childhood memory?” “What emotion do you experience the most?” “What do you almost always procrastinate on?” “Do you believe in purpose in life? Do you have/know your purpose?” “What is that one thing you have always wished to try out but never found the courage to do?” \"What's on your bucket list for this lifetime?\" \"What's your biggest passion?\" \"Is there anything you change in your current day-to-day life? If so, is there anything you think you can do to get there?\" “What are you afraid of?” “Do you have any convictions you’re willing to sacrifice for?” “How do you react to your mistakes?” “How do you react to change?” “What is the sweetest thing you have ever done for a girl?” “What is your favorite thing about being a guy?” “What do you consider your most valuable skill? Most useless too?” “How do you want to be remembered?” Questions are great conversation starters, so if you're preparing for a date with a guy you like, it's a good idea to have a couple in mind. They also bring people closer. Funny questions, personal questions, and deep philosophical questions can all help you get to know a person better, and they double as a way to break any awkward moments of silence. If you’re still wondering how to ask a guy deep questions, here’s some step-by-step advice. First, get your partner. Now, your partner could be anyone you want to get closer to and find a space where you are likely not to be interrupted. Make them comfortable. You don’t want them freaking out or dreading what to expect. Maintain eye contact. Deep questions to ask a guy may make him shy, but they tend to feel safer when they see vulnerability. What is a deep question? Where a surface-level question like, \"what's your favorite season?\" or \"what's your favorite color?\" won't tell you all too much about a person, deep questions are interesting questions that often require a bit more thought from the person who answers. A deep question can serve as an icebreaker for a deep conversation. Asking deep questions will allow you to get to know someone on a deeper level. Some examples of deep questions are, “what do you consider your biggest accomplishment in life?” or \"what would you say was the most important moment in your life so far? A moment that really shaped who you are as a person?\" or \"what have been some of the highest and lowest points in your life so far?\" These questions will offer you insight into what made the person you're talking to who they are today. When you ask deeper questions, you'll learn about their personal history, how they think, and how they see the world. If you're just meeting someone, a deep question doesn't have to be heavily personal. It can also look something like asking, \"how would you change the world if you could?\" or \"how would the world change if there were no celebrities? What differences do you think we'd see in society?\" What questions can I ask my crush? If you have a crush and want to get to know them better, asking deep philosophical questions or deep questions, in general, is a great way to go. When you are just getting to know someone, you can ask questions like, \"What's your biggest fear?” “Who has influenced your life the most?” What is that thing you love about yourself the most?” “what is that one event that made you feel your biggest adrenaline rush?” “What embarrasses you the most, especially when you are in front of other people?” or \"What's on your bucket list?\" These are personal questions in the sense that they will help you get to know your crush better. Still, they're not too personal. The same is true for classic questions like, \"what's the craziest thing you've ever done?\" “What was that one thing that you mostly got grounded for?” Overly personal questions might cross a boundary, so save those for later. If you want to keep things lighthearted, you can ask funny questions. An example of a funny question would be something lighthearted like, \"technically speaking, would you consider a hotdog to be a sandwich? What about melted ice cream - what differentiates it from soup?\"  or a hypothetical question such as, \"what do you think aliens would say if they came down and witnessed our society today?\" You can also ask a question that will venture into a crushes romantic side a little bit, such as, \"what do you think is the way to someone's heart, in general?\" What is the hardest question to ask someone? To some extent, the answer to this question depends on the person you're asking the question to. Some questions, such as deep philosophical questions or questions that ask a person to make a difficult choice, are almost universally challenging to answer. If you're wondering what the most difficult question is to ask someone from the standpoint of the person asking as well as the person answering, the hardest questions to ask are generally personal questions, questions that may prompt a hidden truth or questions that ask a person to share their point of view on a sensitive topic. If you're ever on the fence and think that you could be asking personal questions that veer on the sensitive side, you can preface a question by saying, \"you don't have to answer if you don't want to.\" If you're looking for unconventional questions to ask someone that'll start a deep conversation, you can ask a question along the lines of, \"what do you feel shaped your personality?\" The best part about answering deep questions is that it's a thought-provoking activity. This, in particular, is a question that prompts a multi-faceted answer. It's a question that could start a long and heartfelt conversation, which is often the goal of asking a complex or hard-to-answer question. How do you ask deeper questions? If you want to come up with deeper questions to ask on your own, think about your own personal deep thoughts. When you think about your own personal deep thoughts, you can tap into a diverse set of thought-provoking topics and come up with good questions that'll help you dig even deeper. For example, you might have thoughts about your hopes and dreams, family life, purpose in the world, and what you would do if you had the finances to help and poverty or assist with other world issues. When you think about those matters, you can ask other people what their thoughts are about the same issues. That way, you will not only have ideas for deeper questions, but you will have excellent prompts that will help you connect with the people you love. Here are some tips that would guide you to know how to have deep conversations or ask deep questions: Understand your company . It is important to take into consideration who you are having the conversation with. Even when talking about a sensitive matter with your good friend, you still want to be careful how you go about it. There is a right time for depth. A first date or a hangout is not likely the best time to start asking deep questions. For someone, you recently met, or you are just trying to get to know, you should keep things light-hearted, at least, until you are sure you are comfortable enough to begin to have deep conversations with them, and they, with you. You do not want to come off as intrusive or rude by asking the wrong questions. The setting is important. There is the right time and place for everything, and that applies to asking deep questions. If you are having a chat with someone at a mutual friend’s birthday party, that may not be the ideal place to start asking deep questions. However, if you are having a third gaze staring at the stars over a bottle of wine, asking deep questions would be very helpful in establishing a deep connection. Knowing the right place to start a conversation is just as important as knowing how to start the conversation. Pay attention to body language. It is important to be sensitive when conversing with people, even the people you are closest to. If you notice that they don’t seem comfortable during the conversation, don’t push it. Not everyone would be comfortable opening up to some territories, and there is nothing wrong with that. Don’t take offense if someone tells you they are not ready or willing to discuss personal or deep topics. Be careful with deep questions. Make use of deep questions sparingly. Deep questions usually carry weight and may even evoke emotions. Don’t keep shooting one immediately after another. When you ask one, take a pause and use the person’s response to build on the conversation. Take part in the conversation. Try not to make the conversation one-sided. Participate in the conversation. Open up as well; this way, the person would become much more relaxed and freer to open up to you too. It is not an interview; deep questions should lead to deep conversations. How do you start a deep conversation with your best friend? If you want to start a deep conversation with your best friend, asking deeply personal questions is a great place to start. Personal deep questions don’t have to be groundbreaking or intrusive. In fact, a deep question is merely one that helps your best friend to think before answering. Deep questions can even be based on a silly or ridiculous premise! When you’re asking your best friend some deep questions to get a conversation going, it’s best to start with more superficial questions with straightforward answers. For example, you might ask, “Do you play a musical instrument?” or “What’s your favorite book?” These questions have clear and straightforward answers, but the answers are still a great jumping-off point for sharing experiences and ideas. So, questions and answers can be good for a best friend, a new friend, or even close friends if you’re trying to get a conversation going and keep it going. Here are some follow-up questions that go a little deeper and rely on sharing experiences and opinions that can be further discussed with your best friend: What’s a dream you’ve had more than once throughout your life? If you had to spend the rest of your life listening to one musician, who would it be? Which family member do you feel closest to in your family? Do you have a favorite memory of your best birthday while you were growing up? What’s your biggest goal in life? What’s your biggest fear related to that goal? Have you ever had your heart broken? Have you ever broken someone’s heart? What’s the craziest thing you’ve eaten? What are your health and fitness goals? What is that thing you wish you could change about the entire world? What’s the craziest thing you’ve told your teacher or parent as an excuse? If you won the lottery for one million dollars, what is the first thing you’d buy? What if it was a billion dollars? If money was no object and you had a one-year time limit, where in the world would you travel? What’s your favorite piece of playground equipment and why? What’s your favorite toy? These questions to ask friends are a great place to start if you’re looking for a conversation starter. When you’re talking with a friend questions, open up new topics to discuss. Remember, when you’re asking interesting questions – or even weird questions – the goal is to have a conversation. You don’t need to stick to a list of questions and answers. Instead, start with a couple of interesting questions and see where the conversation goes from there! How well do you know your best friend's questions? You’ve experienced a lot of life with your best friend, and it seems that no one knows you as they do. They make life easier, they have a great sense of humor, and they’re always ready for some interesting questions - or even weird questions. But what are some best friend questions and answers that can give some insight as to how well you really know your best friend and how well your best friend really knows you? If you think you know your best friend, don’t be surprised if you both can answer these questions about the other: What’s on your bucket list/list of things to do before you die? What about your best friend? What’s your favorite thing to eat for breakfast? What about your best friend? What is the best gift that you’ve ever given? That you’ve ever received? What about your best friend? If you could make a new friend with any historical figure, who would it be? What about your best friend? What one appliance or machine (real or imaginary) would make your life easier and why? What about your best friend? Even if you and your best friend can’t answer a single one of these interesting questions – or even weird questions – about each other, don’t worry! They might be a new friend, and you might still be getting to know each other. Being a best friend isn’t just about answering a list of questions about the other person. Being a best friend is also about being open, honest, and reliable. You can’t be a best friend just by knowing information about the other person: you have to act and behave like a best friend, too! You should also expect anyone to call your best friend to act and behave like a best friend, too. What are hard questions to ask? The hardest questions to ask are the ones that either have unknown and high-stakes answers or the ones that open up difficult conversations. Of course, such hard questions have their time and place, and they’re usually reserved for a close partner, family member, or best friend. These aren’t the kind of questions you’d ask a new friend. Questions that you don’t know the answer to and that have high-stakes answers are difficult to ask. Such questions might range from asking someone out on a date, to ask a best friend for a loan, to asking someone their opinion of a big project that you’ve recently completed. In all of these cases, the answer – whether it’s coming from a boss, partner, a good friend, or even your best friend – will have a big impact on your self-image and your life circumstances. You don’t know the answer upfront often causes some anxiety, which can easily lead to dreading. This anxiety and dread can lead you to perceive the question as difficult to ask. You might even consider it best to walk away and never asked. However, even though asking a question with an unknown answer might bring on some stress, it’s best to ask and get the information you need to make decisions. Another type of question that is hard to ask is questions that open up difficult conversations. It’s another one of those situations where you might think it best to walk away and never asked. However, in many cases, such a question is necessary since it opens up a necessary conversation between you and your family member, partner, or best friend. For example, you might have to ask your partner if they’ve been cheating or your best friend if they’ve been struggling with social or mental health issues. The question will almost certainly open up a long and involved conversation with your partner or best friend in both cases. If you want to have a productive conversation after asking a hard question, it’s a good idea to have some follow up questions and tag questions (such as, “Do you agree with that?” or “What do you think?”) on hand so that you can keep the conversation going. Remember, even though you’re asking your partner or best friend, it can still be difficult to open a deep conversation like that. Although some questions are hard to ask, it’s usually the answers that people are afraid of. However, getting these answers straight from your family member, partner, or best friend is the most direct and open way to have productive and meaningful conversations. This is especially true when asking a hard question could lead to addressing and solving problems together. What are interesting questions to ask a guy? Is your greatest fear that you will not have anything to talk about with a friend? Perhaps you have personal questions that you want to ask, but you are not sure how to get a guy to open up or how to get a piece of advice on a deeply unsettling topic. While you can ask simple questions like “what is your favorite tv show?” sometimes, posing personal questions as though you are playing a game like “Would You Rather?” can also help break the ice to gain personal information or insight. Putting personal questions in the form of hypothetical questions may be the best way to break the ice if you are not sure how to broach the subject with a friend. For example, you can also ask personal questions like: Would you rather have broken someone’s heart to get out of a bad relationship or marry them to avoid confrontation? What does a successful relationship mean to you? Is there something you love to do but that others would likely consider ‘weird’ if they got to know about it? Would you rather feel accomplished in life from working your way up the ladder or never work a day in your life but be a millionaire? Would you rather relive the same day for a whole year or lose a year of your life? Would you rather pose conversation starters on social media to gain knowledge about your family and friend’s political beliefs, or as a stranger in a bar, ask personal questions about who to vote for in an election? Would you rather learn something new every day of your life or live off the knowledge you gained from one past spontaneous thing you’ve done? While these random questions are not as dynamic as “would you rather kiss a french kiss or frog or eat a snake,” they can be conversation starters. You can use the responses your nice guy friends give you to dive deeper into more personal questions as a follow-up to gain personal information using these random questions. Depending on how these seemingly random questions or personal questions are answered, you can follow them up with new conversation starters: Tell me about the time you broke someone’s heart. What is the best compliment you have ever received? What is your favorite song? If you had a magic wand or had the power to make your life perfect right now, what would that new life look like? What is the first thing you notice about a person? What three habits do you think will improve your life at the moment? What is that one thing in your life that you are most grateful for? If there is one person- dead or alive that you could have dinner with, who would that person be? What is your favorite season, and why? What makes you laugh the most? What is that one thing you can spend the whole day talking about? Who would you say made the biggest impact on your life to give you that work ethic? Why would you rather ask random questions to a stranger than your friends? What personal questions would you ask your social media friends to gain additional insight? While your friends may rebel about you asking follow-up questions, the point is to ask personal questions or random questions to lead you to the next question you are looking to have answered. If you have classic questions about a guy personal in nature, like “how many women have they slept with?” or “have you ever broken someone’s heart on purpose?” using a game can be an ice breaker. You can then ask, was it just one time you broke someone’s heart or was there more than one time you broke someone’s heart? Asking these personal questions can establish a track record, which may be important if you are interested in dating this guy. Finding deep questions to ask a guy you like can be challenging, so using this game format can help you ask those personal questions you have been dying to know. If you have an open relationship with someone posing deep questions, asking a guy may be easier, especially if you are good friends. However, the more personal questions you ask, the more your friend may be suspicious of your intent. Unless you typically ask each other personal questions about your dating lives or sexual encounters, asking personal questions out of the blue may be intimidating for both of you. If this is the case, then utilizing a game can best the least intrusive way to ask personal questions and gain honest answers. What is the most difficult question to ask a person? Modern life is quite busy, and getting distracted from people is easier than knowing about them. We all indeed have our thoughts, ideas, and philosophies. However, we tend to conceal certain thoughts because we think they’re too personal to be shared, or nobody would be interested in listening to them. So, superficial conversations are inevitable. An interesting way to break through superficial conversation is to participate in a series of question games or ask open-ended questions. Questions are the perfect way of establishing interests in a person and, in this case, knowing about someone. No matter how close you feel to a person, there’s a lot of content about them that is still unknown. Sometimes, they could exhibit a character that makes your mind ponder how much you know about them. Getting a person to open up their heart to you may be challenging. General questions sometimes become boring or irritating, but personal questions could be extremely useful in getting to know who you’re conversing with on a deeper level. Although you may not have issues asking your close friends personal questions, you want to avoid prying into people’s lives. Let’s face it, you may run out of things to say, and it could get awkward fast. Those general questions work for any regular situation, but if you’re seeking to build a deeper relationship, you may need to up your game. To open a person’s heart, consider deep questions about what would genuinely reveal confidential information or more private information. According to Psychology Professor Dan McAdams , there are three levels of knowledge with someone. This could progress depending on the kind of relationship you’re keeping with the individual in question. Level 1- General Traits. At this level, you have an idea of personality traits, favorite hobbies, and how good they are in openness. Level 2- Personal concern. This is when you know a person’s goals, values, and motivations. It’s more of a broader picture of people’s lives. Level 3- Self-narrative. Finally, you can say you know a person at this level. It’s more than just the fun questions because they tell stories about themselves and how they’ve made it through life. If you’re asking how you’d move through these three phases, you’re asking a good question. Level 1 is typically for conversations, asking fun questions. Or do the 21 questions game. The second level is more natural and flows as you live with someone or share experiences. Lastly, level 3 is more purposeful and puts you in a safer space. When meeting new people, the questions you’d ask them are different from date questions. Therefore, the questions game might suffice among new friends, but the questions you’ll ask are completely different when you're into someone. An efficient way to break through the conversation barrier is to get to know someone on a deeper level. Therefore, the hardest questions to ask anyone are deep questions about issues they’d rather not talk about. If you sense that the mood is too serious or edgy, you may consider playing a game first before proceeding. The next time you find yourself amidst friends and away from the usual buzz, you may try asking them personal questions and seeing their willingness to share. If they are, and you do pay attention, you’ll learn a lot about them while boosting your relationship. When you have other interests, you must be pretty special if a guy decides to open up to you. Deep questions to ask a guy are particularly distinctive because men sometimes want to date without opening up. The belief is that men avoid opening up because they don’t want to be seen as weird or weak. Sometimes, deep questions to ask a guy helps you see another part of them- a softer and more vulnerable part. Before putting forward deep questions to ask a guy, you may consider the following; Don’t be persistent about him opening up as men often like to be free with their expression. Avoid assuming or attacking him. Don’t suddenly switch into talking about things deeply. If you already know the other person and feel comfortable with you, your approach is the next thing you want to work on. You want to give them a safe space to open up. When they begin to answer the questions, don’t cut them off or jump in with your opinions. Remember, this is not a girlfriend questions session. Let it flow at their pace, and don’t be judgmental. How do you play 20 questions to get to know someone? If you want to play 20 questions to get to know someone, ask questions about someone’s life and who they are as a person. When you play 20 questions to get to know someone, you might ask questions to get to know someone better, such as: If you had a career besides your own, what would it be? What is your biggest passion? What matters to you the most in life? What is an inaccurate assumption that people make about you if any? Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? What is something about you that most people wouldn’t expect? What makes you feel the most alive? What are your favorite music albums of all time? Do you like camping? What were you like as a kid? What does your dream house look like? Do you have a go-to order at a restaurant? What are your favorite scents? If you want to ask date questions, these make good questions for those who want icebreaker questions to start a conversation and for those who want to play a game of 20 questions. The best icebreaker questions and questions to get to know someone better tend to be open-ended questions, so if you’re looking for questions to get to know someone better, whether it’s an initial icebreaker or not, ask something that can’t be answered with one word or a simple “yes” or “no.” This is a great way to get the conversation going. What are interesting questions to ask? If you are looking for an interesting question, there are a variety of routes to go. You might be asking questions to get to know someone better, or you might be looking to start a deep or interesting conversation. Unconventional questions are good questions to ask if you want to have an interesting conversation or catch someone by surprise by asking a question they wouldn’t expect to be asked. Hypothetical questions are one way to achieve this. If you ask a question about a scenario that is unlikely to actually take place in real life, such as, “if you had the chance to use a time machine, would you?” or “If you were a food or beverage item, what would you be?” it can start an entertaining dialogue. You might unveil something you didn’t know about the person. What are some deeply personal questions? When it comes to questions to get to know someone better, at a certain point, asking in-depth questions, deep questions, personal questions, and so on is the best way to go - especially if you already have a connection but want to get closer. Here is some deep, personal question to ask: Do you have any regrets? If you were to go right now, what would you regret not doing? Would you say that you are religious or spiritual? What are your strengths and weaknesses? Do you think social media impacts you more negatively or more positively? In your opinion, what are the positives and negatives of technology? Who in your family are you closest to? What have your biggest challenges in life been? How did you work through them? What, if any, are some ways you differ from your family ? If you could spend a day with your younger self, what would you do? What would you say to them? If you had to give a speech on the spot, what would it be about? What’s something you’re nostalgic about? What are the questions to ask? Here are some questions to ask whether you want to start a conversation or want to ask questions to get to know someone better: Where would you live if you had to move to a different city/state/town? What’s your favorite thing about yourself? What are you most grateful for? How much has your life changed over the past few years? Where do you see yourself five years into the future? What have the best years of your life been so far, and why? Would you consider yourself spontaneous, or are you more of a planner? What are some current trends you enjoy? What are some current trends you dislike? Is there an annoying question you don’t like being asked? What is a quote that you always remember? What is a good question? A good question will vary based on several factors, such as the context and the purpose of the question. Questions that are fun or unique will often have people saying, “I love this question!” Many people also have a preference for open-ended questions, particularly as conversation starters.

It's almost inevitable – you spend a lot of time in your daily life talking about surface-level, mundane things . And we all know: From the latest gossip at work, to being lost in generally polite conversation topics with strangers at a bar, to re-visiting the same social media posts with friends, it can become rather boring to just be keeping up with whatever is expected of you in a conversation. Why is this, though? Because as a strong, motivated man, you crave depth in your conversations – you know that there's more that lies beneath the surface of every person, and have a genuine desire to find the right questions to ask to lead the conversation in a more fulfilling direction. We've put together a list of our favorite types of deep questions to ask , so that you can get started with, or enhance your repertoire of ways to break through the monotony of everyday conversation and really start learning what it is that makes people who they are. Take a look through the following areas of deep conversation topics , and commit a few of them to memory to be prepared for wherever your conversations might lead you throughout the day. Contents Conversation Starters The Best Highly Interesting With A Girl For Couples Thought Provoking 16 Deep Conversation Topics Starting List via: Unsplash / Anita Peeples Let's say there's someone you want to start a conversation with, but they seem to be a little heady for you. They're big readers or intellectuals, and you don't want to come off vapid , right? In that situation, what you need isn't just your standard set of conversation starters , you need deep conversation starters that earn a reaction and immediately put you on the right footing . Try a few of these next time to set a deep and thoughtful tone to your conversation with deep and thoughtful people. Here are 16 deep conversation starting topics: 1. What do you do to impress others deliberately? You're asking for self-reflection and sincerity here . 2. What will you never do? Find out what lines a person draws and how that defines them. 3. What’s an uncommon belief you hold? This answer could be anything and lead anywhere, but it's sure to have a lot of depth. 4. What does your joy look like today? \"Joy\" is such a personal and powerful term . It's deeper than happiness and far more personal. 5. Would you rather have less work or more work that you enjoy doing? What is the point of work? And should we find it enriching or just get it over with? via: Pexels / Startup Stock Photos 6. What is important enough to go to war over? It's an ugly and heavy responsibility, but what is really worth fighting for , if anything? 7. What does ‘The American Dream’ mean to you? Another complex topic, and this one has such a personal side to it. 8. If you could instill one piece of advice in a newborn baby’s mind, what advice would you give? You're asking them to condense all their wisdom to one simple point . 9. Are you more worried about doing things right, or doing the right things? A question of ethics without an easy answer. 10. What do you do over and over again that you hate doing? Another chance for self-reflection, and to discuss flaws and how to overcome them. via: Unsplash / Lily Banse 11. What do you understand today about your life that you did not understand a year ago? Give them a chance to discuss personal growth on a deep and meaningful level. 12. What makes you uncomfortable? A chance for a little confession and the answers may shock you. 13. What one ‘need’ and one ‘want’ will you strive to achieve in the next twelve months? A great, goal-oriented question to see where this person sees themselves in the near future. 14. What will you never give up on? It could be an ideal, a person, or a sports team, but it's sure to have deep meaning to them. 15. When you look into the past, what do you miss the most? Nostalgia is one of our most powerful, and deepest, emotions. via: Unsplash / Yana Tkachenko 16. What’s the best part of being you? Define yourself, then feel pride in yourself . A great way to get people in a good mood to be deep. The 3 Best Deep Conversation Topics via: Unsplash / Product School Having a few of the best deep conversation topics, and deep questions to ask stored in your memory is a great way to breathe new life into a conversation. Use these when you're not entirely sure where to take the conversation, but want to open up a dialogue that can go deeper with whomever you're speaking to. Here are the top 3 conversation topics: Challenges Every person will face a unique series of challenges in their life – and their responses to these challenges will shape them as a person. If you know the challenges that you're facing, you can prepare better for them, and speak more honestly about what it is that you want out of your life. Learn more about your conversation partner's challenges with these challenge-topic questions: 17. What is your biggest day-to-day challenge? Every day is a new opportunity to learn and grow, but you can only do this if you're aware of what challenges you. 18. Do you find your work challenging and interesting? Challenging work can be a fantastic catalyst for personal growth. 19. How often do you set goals for yourself? Having something to work towards keeps a person motivated, and setting goals keeps you on track. 20. What kind of goals do you have for the next year? Looking towards the future can put the present into perspective. via: Bigstockphoto / Rawpixel 21. When have you given up on something? Or, more importantly, was it justified? Sometimes we have to let things go and move onto the next challenge. Purpose Your purpose in life – and your own understanding of what that might be – can be a great source of inspiration and inner strength. For the person with a clear purpose, it's an amazing chance to share that with someone else; for the person without such a clear sense, talking about these things can help to clarify what it is that they are meant to be doing. Here are a few 'purpose' based conversation questions: 22. Where do you find purpose in your life? Whether job, family, or hobbies, a person's priorities say a lot about their sense of purpose. 23. Do you find purpose in your work? About a third of anyone's life is spent at work; is it worthwhile? 24. If you won the lottery, would you keep working in your current profession? Is the work they're doing important for more than just money? via: Unsplash / Tamarcus Brown 25. Do you think people have a \"higher calling\" in life? If so, how do you go about finding that purpose and honoring it? 26. What have you been most proud of learning lately? If you stop learning, you stop growing; people who learn more find more purpose in life. Family and Friends Family, be they through blood or through mutual experiences, are your support system; when the rest of life starts bearing down on you, your ability to turn to loved ones can make all the difference. Everybody has memories of their family and friends that go much deeper than day-to-day activities. Open up a deeper conversation about family and friends with questions like these: 27. Who do you consider as family? Family isn't only by blood relation, after all. 28. What role does family play in your life? What sort of relationship do they have with their family? via: Pexels / Lela Johnson 29. What is your best friend like? The people you spend the most time around have a huge influence on you – even more so with your best friend. 30. How did you meet your best friend? The moment you meet someone important to you marks a big phase in your life, with deep implications for your future. 31. How much time do you spend with your family? And what sort of influence does that have on you? 15 Super Interesting Deep Conversation Topics via: Pexels / Polina Zimmerman When general deep questions can seem a bit too formal, move towards something more interesting. These questions cover interesting conversation topics that just about anyone can get interested in, as they apply equally across the whole range of human experience. Here are 15 deep, yet super interesting conversation topics: Culture Culture is such an interesting topic because it's hard to pin down to any one definition – you can have a whole slew of interesting conversation topics that cover a wide range of preferences and open up the conversation to new input. Explore culture with your conversation partner with questions like these: 32. What role does music play in culture? People have been fascinated with music since before recorded history, and music is said to \"speak to the soul\". 33. Does language affect how we see the world? Bonus question: Do you speak more than one language? 34. Do you think you could live in another country? Interesting on its own, this is also indirectly asking, \"how well do you deal with big changes?\" 35. Which world culture is the most fascinating to you? Each unique culture has elements that resonate with certain people on a deeper level. 36. Do you believe the way we dress affects how we think? Shabby or chic, the way we dress definitely affects what other people think of us – but what about how we think of ourselves? via: Unsplash / Chelsea Francis Human Nature Everyone who pays attention to their daily experiences can weigh in on the topic of human nature – making it an ideal go-to topic if you're not sure what the person you're talking to is interested in. If you're interested in human nature, you're interested in life itself , which might be the deepest conversation topic of all. Lead into some of the deepest conversation topics in life with some of the following: 37. Are people defined by the culture they grew up in? The classic \" nature versus nurture \" argument, this one questions what is most deeply ingrained in you. 38. Are people better at creating things, or destroying things? A person's view on this reveals an optimistic or pessimistic attitude, which will affect their whole life. 39. If you had to sum up human nature in 3 words, which would you choose? Simple answers can often provoke deeper thought than long, complex ones. 40. Which is more important: The human body, or the human mind? Placing importance on intellect or physicality can definitely change a person. Where is your deepest connection to yourself? via: Pexels / Dazzle Jam 41. Why do people do things which they know are bad? Or, what is the line between \"good\" and \"bad\" in the first place? The Future Thinking about how our lives may continue to grow, and what we might experience in the future, is a uniquely human trait. Talking about the future with someone shows you where their attention is at, by giving insight into what they see coming of their life in the near or distant future. Look towards the future with questions like the following: 42. Do you think the future will be brighter or darker than today? Another way of asking the old \"glass half full/half empty\" question, which shows a person's deepest attitudes towards life. 43. What role do humans play in shaping the future? How much do our choices matter for what we're likely to experience soon? 44. Do you think we'll colonize another planet? Would that be a good thing? If it's necessary to find a way to live on another planet, what does that say about life on Earth? via: Unsplash / Daniel Olah 45. What will be most important to you in 10 years? As we learn and grow, our priorities change; is your future something that you look forward to? 46. Will the next generation be in a better or worse position than ours? If better, why? And if worse, what can we do about it? 15 Deep Conversation Topics to Talk about with a Girl via: Pexels / Jopwell If you're looking for questions to get to know a girl better, certain topics carry a lot more weight than general superficial or deep questions. Memorize a few of these deep questions to ask a girl , in each category, and you'll be ready to make a stronger connection when the opportunity arises. Roles The roles we play, and how well we play them, determine a lot about how we experience the world around us. Lots of girls (and guys) today aren't comfortable with the roles that they feel they've been forced into, and really appreciate the opportunity to talk about what it is they actually want to be doing with their lives. Have an honest, deep conversation about roles by starting with some of these questions: 47. How do our roles define us in society? Everyone plays different roles throughout their lives. What do they mean about who they are? via: Pexels / Skitterphoto 48. Are our roles defined for us, or do we define them? Or, how much do we contribute to defining ourselves as people? 49. If you could choose to be anything, what would you be? This one isn't limited only to career options, but for how a person would want to be in a moral sense, too. 50. How does our role in life affect how other people see us? The way others perceive us creates both new limitations and new opportunities. 51. Are you comfortable with the role(s) you play in life? Because really, just because a person is good at a role doesn't mean it's the right one for them. Love and Loss With how fast the modern world seems to be moving, you're more likely to experience love and loss over and over again in your life than any generation that has come before. The people you love, and the people you lose, contribute so much to how you view life – which makes it one of my favorite topics for deep questions to ask a girl . Find what love and loss mean to the girl you're speaking to with the following questions: 52. Is it better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved before? The British poet Alfred Lord Tennyson penned this classic. It quickly tells you what they think about love/past love. 53. How important is it to you to be in love? And as a follow up, what does it mean to you to be in love? A person must love themselves before loving others. 54. Have you ever lost something important to you? We all must learn to deal with loss in our own ways; getting to the core of our ability to cope with loss is a necessary part of growing up. 55. Can you have love without having loss? Realistically, the two are opposite sides of the same coin – but this understanding can only be reached through a deep connection with your own experiences. 56. What does it really mean to love someone? This will be different for different types of love (familial, romantic, friendly, etc.). via: Pexels / Gustavo Fring Happiness Almost everything you do in life can be measured against how it affects your happiness because happiness is so often what makes the experience of life seem worthwhile. The things that affect a girl's happiness will affect her entire life, making it a great segue into other deep conversation topics. Look at the bright side of deep questions with inquires like these: 57. What makes you smile in the morning? Because each day is a chance at something new and beautiful. 58. How important is happiness to you? Valuing your own happiness, and the happiness of others is a hard-earned lesson that stays deep within a person. 59. Does your job bring you happiness? With the amount of time we spend in our jobs, they should contribute to a better life. Does theirs? 60. Are you happy with your current experience of life? And if not, what are you doing to change that? via: Pexels / Pixabay 61. What do you do to make other people happy? Happiness is best, and deepest, when shared with others. 10 Deep Conversation Topics for Couples via: Unsplash / Mahkeo Whether you've been in a relationship for six days, six months, or six years, there's always room to know each other more deeply. Asking good questions for couples , that have to do with both of you is a sure way to open the door for further conversations about how you want to choose to live your life together. Here are 2 great conversation starters for couples: Goals For any sort of relationship, but especially for couples, having goals that you can work towards together goes a long way towards making your relationship worthwhile. By planning together for the future, it can make even the most mundane, everyday tasks seem important for how they contribute to your goals. Get yourselves on the same page with goal-setting questions like the following: 62. Where would you like to be living in 5 years' time? Where a couple chooses to live can make a huge difference in how deeply they are able to connect. 63. How often would you like to be traveling? Seeing the world is an amazing way of getting to know someone on a deeper level. via: Pexels / GaPeppy1 64. What goals do you have in your job right now? And are your goals compatible with each others'? 65. Where do you see our relationship at this time next year? Being committed to a life together requires a depth of feeling of hope, optimism, and planning. 66. What's your biggest goal in life right now? And the kicker: How can you help each other with that? Fears In a relationship, you share things with your partner that you might not with anybody else around you. The topic of \"fears\" is perfect for deep questions to ask your girlfriend , because she's more comfortable sharing these intimate details with you than with her casual friends. Share some of your most intimate experiences with some of these questions: 67. What's an irrational fear that you have? We definitely don't always understand our own fears, but being able to question them helps to understand them on a deeper level. via: Unsplash / Francisco Moreno 68. Do you worry about your work? If so, what is the root cause of this? This one prompts deeper thought into something often ignored. 69. What do you fear for in the future? Making a plan to assuage those fears can be a powerful form of relief. 70. How do you deal with things that scare you? Knowing your partner's coping mechanisms lets you learn to support them better in hard times. 71. Which is more important: Fear, or hope? Having a balance between the two keeps us level and healthy in life. via: Pexels / Tobi 7 Deep and Thought Provoking Conversation Topics via: Pexels / Jack Sparrow Some conversations go in one ear and out the other. Others make an impression that lasts forever. These thought provoking questions encourage the latter. Coming up with new topics to talk about is no easy task, especially with people you already know well. Use these topics to invigorate the mind and challenge the status quo. These topics are guidelines, but the possibilities are endless. Use them to start conversations that can go in any direction. Before you start a discussion with these deep topics, think about your responses. You don't want to start a conversation and have nothing to contribute. At the same time, let the conversation flow and follow its own course. Spontaneity is the lifeblood of a memorable dialogue. Here are 7 of the best deep and thought provoking conversation topics: 72. They say you learn something new every day. What did you learn yesterday? And if you can't remember what you learned, did you really learn it? 73. Why can humans create and other beings cannot? And the answer isn't just opposable thumbs. 74. Do you view others as supporting characters in your story, or main characters in their story? Is it solipsistic in here, or is that just me? via: Unsplash / Tyler Nix 75. What actions would you take to earn a loved one's trust back, after you have broken it? And at what point is a relationship beyond repair? 76. If you had to be filled with one food ingredient what would it be? Water doesn't count. 77. Security or freedom? Can you have both? 78. What makes words what they are? The evolution of language is a strange and complex thing. Try to create your own words and assign them meaning.

A few years ago, I was at dinner with new friends. In the middle of the table sat a deck of cards . But instead of numbers and suits, these cards were pastel-colored and printed with questions.  When I left later that night, I felt connected and cared for.  “Where’s the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?” and “Who’s your personal hero?” We went around the room, answering questions both serious and silly. I’d never engaged in conversation like that before—not with new friends. It was intentional, and when I left later that night, I felt connected and cared for. I also felt like my new friends were now old friends. Mindful conversation topics are perfect for deepening relationships and fostering meaningful discussions, whether with strangers, family members, or friends old and new. Our team curated the below list at the beginning of COVID, and we’ve since been using them during our Zoom meetings, which often go long because of the elaborate answers. (We can attest, they work .) Whether you buy your own conversation deck, pull from the questions below, or create your own list, here’s to never wondering what to talk about again!  Mindful topics are a wonderful way to deepen relationships or foster meaningful conversations.  Have you had a great conversation lately?

            "45 Conversation Starters to Bolster Your Bond with Your Friends and Family PsychCentral Subscribe 45 Conversation Starters to Bolster Your Bond with Your Friends and Family Medically reviewed by Scientific Advisory Board — Written by Margarita Tartakovsky, MS on March 22, 2015 Is this a familiar scenario? You’re sitting around the table, at home or at a restaurant. You and your loved ones have already talked about each other’s days. You’ve already discussed the delicious meal and any upcoming plans. And now you’re sitting and maybe eating. In silence. Or maybe everyone is looking down and tinkering with their phones. Or maybe you have lively, fascinating conversations when you’re together. But you’d like to dig deeper. That’s where questions come in. Questions give us the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of each other, of ourselves. According to Garry Poole in his book The Complete Book of Questions: 1001 Conversation Starters for Any Occasion , “ There is something powerful about questions that force you to think, look within yourself, examine your heart, and search for answers. And it’s in the process of responding to those questions that you often make discoveries about yourself — things you never even realized before.” The right questions help us make these deep discoveries about our loved ones. We get to learn surprising insights we otherwise wouldn’t be privy to. There are many things we don’t know about our friends and family, and ourselves. Here are 45 questions to help you get to know your loved ones a whole lot better and bolster your bond. Be sure to follow up each question with “Why?” What’s something about yourself that you hope will never change? What books have you read that’ve had a big influence on you? What goals have you recently set for yourself? How are you doing with these goals so far? What strange habit do you have? What do you think is your best quality? What fear would you like to overcome? What person, dead or alive, do you wish you could be more like? Growing up, what was your favorite children’s story or fairy tale? What’s your favorite poem or saying? What’s one of your greatest accomplishments? What was your favorite subject in school? How have your priorities changed over time? Who’s had the biggest influence on you? Have you ever helped a complete stranger? How? What’s your earliest childhood memory? What nightmare woke you up in a panic? What memorable lesson did you learn from your parents? If you could travel back in time, what year would you visit? If you could spend an hour doing anything, what would it be? If you could visit with any person in history, who would it be? If you could go anywhere for dinner tomorrow, where would you go? If you could turn into any animal, which one would you be? If you could write a bestselling book, what would it be about? If you were a painter, what picture would you paint first? What does success mean to you? Why are some people cruel and unkind? What does it mean when two people have chemistry? What do you think is the most significant event in the history of the human race? What is the meaning of life? What’s one thing you know for sure? What scares you the most about the future? What would make you totally content right now? What’s the hardest thing you’ve ever done? What lesson has failure taught you? How do you deal with doubt? When was the last time you cried? What stresses you out? What was the greatest day of your life? Why do you think there are so many religions in the world? What is your definition of a miracle? When do you pray? How often? What motivates you to pray? When do you feel most alone? Do you believe the human soul is eternal? What’s something about you that no one knows? What fills up your heart to bursting level? Get curious about your loved ones, their thoughts and dreams, their perspectives on the world and life. Ask these questions tonight at dinner or tomorrow at lunch. Ask them during a date with your partner. No doubt they’ll spark interesting conversations. Maybe these questions will spark other questions you’d like to learn the answers to. Whatever questions you ask, Poole stresses the importance of listening to the answers. Give your loved ones your undivided attention as they speak. Try to understand where they’re coming from. It’s these kinds of conversations that strengthen our relationships and which we treasure looking back.

That's probably much more productive than the stream of expletives that goes through my mind first thing. 🙂 Jackie Paulson February 15, 2011 at 9:00 pm - Reply Hello, and I found your blog from Post       : 5 Hard Questions to Ask Yourself URL        : http://valcitygal.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/5-hardquestions-to-ask-yourself/ I'd love to say I am living my dreams, but not just yet.  I am working on a \"poem\" book, which I love.  I am passionate about getting it published.  I am so grateful each day for it is Gods gift to me or you.  My motto is \" if I am Above Ground, It's a great day, or If I am not listed in today's obituaries, I am happy.\"  Great blog and so much fun Annette Renee White February 15, 2011 at 9:10 pm - Reply Wow!

A fulfilled life isnât so much determined by what you know as it is by how willing you are to learn. The most obvious way to learn is by asking questions. You do that every day without thinking about it. Itâs the most direct way to access necessary information to get by, do your work, or understand your loved ones. But what about your inner world? Are you as eager to get to know yourself as youâre curious about others? If you are, here are some deep questions to ask yourself to increase self-awareness. No one else can answer these for you. Asking self-reflection questions is like peeling an onion. Every time you think you found the answer, new questions arise. Thereâs always another layer to take off if youâre curious enough to see whatâs underneath. Self-awareness is a never-ending journey, and itâs also unique to you. The questions youâll find in this post may not lead to definite answers. Instead, theyâll be a compass for navigating your self-discovery. But before we jump to the questions, how about a short introduction? What Is Self-Awareness and Why Should You Care? Self-awareness is such a buzzword these days. We throw it around as if it was obvious what it means. But different people may have very different ideas about it. On top, itâs easy to believe youâre self-aware even when youâre not. Tasha Eurich, whoâs been researching this topic for decades, found that even though most people in her studies assessed themselves as self-aware, only 10-15% of them were right! One reason this is so is that, according to Eurich, there are two sides of self-awareness. Often, people develop just one without concern for the other. Writes Eurich: âInternal self-awareness , represents how clearly we see our own values, passions, aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses), and impact on others.â âExternal self-awareness , means understanding how other people view us, in terms of those same factors listed above.â Self-knowledge isnât only about how you see yourself. Itâs also being aware of how you come across to others. Only this way youâre able to form an accurate, complete image of who you are. Daniel Goleman calls self-awareness the âkeystoneâ of emotional intelligence . According to him, knowing ourselves is a prerequisite to navigating relationships, setting goals and regulating our emotions. Numerous studies confirm this â self-awareness seems to improve just about every aspect of your life. Goleman says that self-awareness can be described as a conglomerate of these three competencies: â Emotional Awareness : Recognizing your emotions and the effects they have on yourself and others. Accurate Self-Assessment : Seeing your strengths and limits from an unbiased point of view. Self-Confidence : Having a strong sense of self-worth and competency which isnât easily shaken by your circumstances. â Each of these competencies can be improved by asking yourself the right questions. You may then bounce your answers off of trusted friends, colleagues or family members. Thatâs how you ensure the âexternal self-awarenessâ component is also there. But first, here are 60 deep questions to ask yourself. Self-knowledge has to start with you. So letâs begin to peel that onion, shall we? 60 Deep Questions To Ask Yourself The self-reflection questions below are divided into three sets. I hand-picked them for you from a ton of self-improvement blogs, coaching sites and books to make sure they help to deepen self-awareness. Thereâs one set of questions for developing emotional awareness , one for accurate self-assessment and one for building self-confidence . Together, they help you build the self-awareness triad as defined by Daniel Goleman. Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to self-reflection questions. Thereâs only your unique answer - and thatâs the only one that matters. 20 Deep Questions For Emotional Awareness Who are you most jealous of and why? How comfortable are you talking about your feelings and with whom? What upsets you about other peopleâs behavior â and what does that say about you? How do you handle difficult but necessary conversations? What demotivates you and what helps you regain motivation after you lose it? When was the last time you felt disappointed or hurt? How did you respond? What is your definition of happiness? In what ways are you preventing your own happiness? How do you typically feel just after waking up and when you go to bed? Has insecurity ever been useful to you? What about overconfidence? Are your actions mostly guided by love or by fear? Do people you surround yourself with lift you up or bring you down? How often do you treat yourself with love and respect? Is there someone who hurt you in the past and whom you still need to forgive? What regrets do you have about the past and what worries you about the future? What social situations make you uncomfortable? When you look back at the past month, what was the most joyful moment you experienced? When you canât sleep at night, what do you usually think about? How do you feel when you see yourself in the mirror? What has the fear of failure stopped you from doing? â 20 Deep Questions for Accurate Self-Assessment What positive qualities do you bring into your close relationships? What tasks and responsibilities do people at work trust you with? What skills do you want to learn in the next five years? In what ways are you contributing to your family, organization or community? What activities make you feel content, energized and fulfilled? What are your strategies for bouncing back after a failure? What threats and opportunities do you currently see in your life? What are you most likely wrong about? What could you give a 30-minute speech on with no preparation? Do you have any addictions? What are they? What do you spend too much time doing? What do you spend not enough time doing? What do you love about yourself? When people come to ask you for help, what do they usually ask for? When you ask others for help, what do you usually ask for? What do you think about when youâre alone? What are three questions you wish you had definite answers to? What is your biggest strength and your biggest weakness? If you could change one decision you made in the past, what would it be? How would you describe yourself in one sentence? What limiting beliefs do you hold about yourself and the world? â 20 Deep Questions for Building Self-Confidence What compliment do you like to hear the most and why? What challenges have you faced in the past that youâre proud of overcoming? What is the mistake you learned from the most? When do you say âI canâtâ most often â and is that actually true? When was the last time you did something that made you feel scared or uncomfortable? What difficult problems have you solved that you initially thought were unsolvable? When was the last time you said ânoâ and felt good about it? What one thing would you do if the success was guaranteed? If you could offer advice to your teenage self, what would you say? What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you? Are you on the right path in life? How can you tell? What accomplishments are you most proud of? When itâs all said and done, will you have said more than youâve done â or vice versa? What changes have you undergone that you thought impossible five years ago? When was the last time you felt empowered? What do you need to tell yourself today? What will you never give up on? What is the best decision youâve ever made? What was the best thing you did for yourself today? When was the last time you surprised yourself? How To Answer Deep Questions To Access Insight Asking yourself deep questions is just the first part of the equation. By picking a self-reflection question, you set a process of self-discovery in motion. You cut into one layer of the onion. To peel it and see whatâs underneath, you need to make a serious attempt to answer that question. How you answer it also matters. There are a few ways of doing it and each may result in slightly different outcomes. Itâs entirely up to you how you choose to answer those deep self-awareness questions. Below, Iâll give you some options and describe whatâs likely to happen as a result. Talking to others This may be the most challenging way of answering deep questions. You can either bring them up yourself, or ask a friend or family member to ask them to you. Then, let them witness you reflecting on the answer. By voicing your response in front of somebody, you can find extra dimensions of self-awareness. Itâs not just about what you say â but also, how. Do you feel nervous or insecure? Do you feel proud of what youâre saying? Are you anticipating a certain reaction? Such observations can provide extra insights about yourself. Additionally, you can then ask for feedback about your answer. This way, you add to the external self-awareness that Tasha Eurich talked about. Recording a voice message Recording your answers in a form of an âaudio journalâ can be an interesting way to answer self-reflection questions. You still get to say your answers out loud â but without the pressure of other people listening. It can be interesting to hear yourself talk when no oneâs around. My guess is that you donât do that very often. Taking a deep question and recording your answer can be a revealing experience regardless of what you say. Another great thing about it is that itâs efficient. When you talk, you can express yourself faster than when you write. Then, thereâs also the advantage of accessing the recording later on and reflecting on it. Journaling about it When it comes to answering deep questions, journaling is your friend.Â By writing about your experiences, you relate to them differently. Your thinking changes when you put words down on paper. Because writing by hand is relatively slow, your mind is also forced to slow down and select words more carefully. Answering self-reflection questions in writing will produce different outcomes than when you talk. To access valuable insight, donât censor what you write. Allow yourself to journal freely, without editing a single word. Once you finish, I recommend taking a few hours break before you read your answers. This way, you get to look at them with fresh eyes and a new perspective. Meditating on it Another way to answer deep questions about yourself is through meditation. The idea is to ask the question â and then, remain open to the answers without âthinking about them.â This is different from journaling or talking. Rather than actively producing the answer, you remove yourself from the process. You ask the question and let your unconscious mind do the work behind the scenes. This requires you to let go of what you think you know about yourself. Be prepared for surprises. To answer your question in this way, you donât need to sit in a formal meditation (although you certainly can). You may also ask the question and go for a walk, do some mindful exercise or take a shower. Meanwhile, observe the thoughts your mind is producing without pushing for a particular outcome. The answers may come when you least expect them. In a dream or after waking up One way of working with your unconscious mind is asking deep questions just before you go to bed. This way, you plant an idea and let your brain work on it while you sleep. This is a technique the world-class chess and tai-chi champion Josh Waitzkin uses for solving big life questions. He calls it MIQ: Most Important Question. Shortly before your bedtime, Waitzkin recommends asking the question thatâs important for you right now. Then, you let it go and fall asleep. This way, your unconscious mind gets to work on the question without any effort on your side. The answer may come in a dream or just after waking up. The next morning, you can use your journal to free-write about the insights you received during the night.Â Write them down first thing after waking up and let yourself find the most important answers: yours. Closing Thoughts A huge part of your life depends on how self-aware you are. If you know what makes you tick, what your fears and desires are, which events trigger what emotions, and so on â then youâre way ahead of the pack. You make better decisions and spend time on the right things. Thatâs because you understand the consequences of your actions. To reach higher levels of self-awareness, there are many deep questions you can ask yourself. The more you ask and look for answers, the more youâre able to learn. You keep peeling consecutive layers of the onion even when other people claim thereâs nothing new to learn. But you know better. You know that answering deep questions usually leads toâ¦ more questions. And, youâre comfortable with that. The deeper you go into this journey, the more you accept that you may never fully know yourself. And thatâs okay. After all, itâs not the answers that matter most. Itâs the process of self-discovery that creates a sense of wonder and joy. Itâs the search itself that creates meaning. That meaning can change from moment to moment, as you keep asking questions. As Victor Frankl said: âThe meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.â â At Big Self School, we believe that outer impact starts with inner growth.

Menu blog post What Self-Love Means: 15 Questions to Ask Yourself. 29 Apr 2018 29 Apr 2018 by breyanaa , posted in Self Love Practicing self-love is not always an easy task. Some don’t know how to love themselves or where to start. You first have to ask yourself, what does loving myself mean to me? It involves learning to accept and be brutally honest with who we are and who we have the potential to be. It requires growth and hard work mentally, emotionally, and physically. There’s so much more to self-love than bubble baths, spa days, and pampering. Self-love isn’t only for women, it’s universal. We all should be dedicating quality time to ourselves. Self-love is choosing ourselves even if that means upsetting others. My motto is “ choose you always ” because you matter, you come first. It may sound selfish to a lot of people but you can not truly love another person until you know what it’s like to love yourself. You have to acquaint the person you see in the mirror, get to know you fully. The things we tend to search for in other people can easily be obtained through self (time, attention, love, care, etc.) and it’s okay to seek those things from others but are you giving them to yourself? Anything you receive from others should only add on to what you’ve been pouring into yourself. Is your relationship with yourself as strong as it could be? Do you treat yourself how you treat others? Do you talk to yourself with kindness and honesty? Your love-language with yourself should be 100%. You have to fill your own cup before you focus on pouring into others and be aware of those who have no intentions on filling you back up. It’s not selfish to take care of you and to make your happiness, peace of mind, and you as a whole, a priority; it’s necessary. In my own life I learned that there needs to be a balance between selflessness and selfishness. I’m the kind of person who likes to pour into others and it took quite some time to realize the love and energy I was giving out wasn’t being reciprocated in some areas. Instead of letting that change who I was, I let it change the way I do things. I now move with the intent to love me better because in loving myself better I set the tone for how others love and approach me. I love being selfless, I love helping others, I love the way I love, but I can’t pour from an empty cup. I’ve accepted that it’s necessary to take all the “me time” I need and to nurture my soul and continuously fall in love with me, myself, & I. We sometimes get lost in others, we get lost in life, we subconsciously allow people and even things like our work, to use us until we no longer recognize who we are. There’s a lot that goes into practicing self-love but it involves building a life we are happy with instead of depending on a significant other to build or help us build a life we are happy with. Can you truly be happy alone? It involves accepting all parts of ourself and committing to not making the same mistakes and dragging ourselves into dark places when we know we can only learn from the past, not change it. Self-love is making time to do what we love, listening to what we need physically, mentally, and spiritually, it’s connecting with ourselves. It’s setting boundaries and knowing our worth. Once you learn how to be happy with yourself, you won’t tolerate being around people who make you feel anything less. I live for self-care and self-love, it’s whats brought me through tough times, it’s gotten me through heartbreaks and heartaches. It’s what keeps me grounded, loved, and balanced. In journeying through self-love, here are some questions to ask yourself. Answer them however you wish whether you journal, speak them out loud or to yourself, etc. but self reflecting is important. What do I need to be more at peace with myself? How do I get there? What has stopped me from forming a healthy relationship with myself in the past? Do I have healthy relationships with others? Do I have a healthy relationship with myself? Have I ever valued someone’s opinion about myself more than my own? Thinking back on past situations; How would some of these situations differ or what would they have looked like if I put myself first? On my journey to self-love have I forgiven myself? What do/did I need to forgive myself for? Do I love myself enough to forgive others? What toxic thoughts and behaviors do I need to rid myself of? What am I going to do to make sure I stay committed to loving me? What am I holding on to that isn’t serving me? How would I like to show love to myself today? What am I grateful for? What do I love and value about myself? How am I feeling? If negative, How can I change the way I’m feeling? When is the last time I told myself “I love you” or “I am enough”? What’s New?

If you struggle to feel confident, there are a variety of techniques you can use to develop trust in yourself and feel good about who you are. Understanding how to improve your self-esteem may help you cultivate positive feelings towards yourself and others. In this article, we review what questions to build self-confidence are and provide a list of examples to help you boost your self-esteem. Related: The Importance of Confident Decision-Making What are questions to build self-confidence? Questions to build self-confidence are inquiries professionals may ask themselves in order to increase their self-esteem and help them feel assured about their skills and abilities. These questions can help individuals reflect on their unique capabilities and appreciate traits about themselves. Being confident may help someone improve their work performance and productivity, and can have a positive impact on their personal and professional relationships. Related: 10 Ways To Boost Your Confidence in the Workplace Questions to ask yourself to build self-confidence If you're interested in improving your self-confidence and positively impacting your self-esteem, consider asking yourself the following questions: What actions and activities make you feel purposeful? Considering when you feel fulfilled and have a sense of purpose may help you feel more capable of creating positive change or implementing effective strategies. Recognizing your purpose may encourage a feeling of assurance or confidence by identifying the substantial contribution you can make to a business or people in your personal life. Ask yourself this question to realign with actions you can take to feel satisfied and impactful. What do you do well? One simple way to improve your self-esteem is to recognize what you to well. Identifying areas where you excel can help you recognize your talents and feel good about your unique skills and capabilities. If you have special training or certifications, you may take pride in the time, effort and commitment it took to earn these credentials, and feel confident about your abilities. What does feeling self-assured mean to you? While you may hope to feel more confident, this may be challenging if you're unsure about what that term means to you. Consider reflecting on what self-assurance may feel like, and the impact it can have on your life. This can help you gain clarity about why you're interested in improving your sense of confidence and highlight the steps you can take to get there. How can you contribute to others feeling confident and capable? While you may take pride in the individual tasks you execute, you may also improve your sense of confidence by reminding others of their skills and capabilities. Making those around you feel good and self-assured may show you the positive impact you can have on others. This can produce feelings of confidence within yourself, and highlight the value of your kind words and thoughtfulness. What do you value and what are your fundamental beliefs? Reconnecting with your values and core beliefs can help you feel more confident. You may boost your self-esteem by identifying causes or initiatives that coordinate with your primary principles. If the company you work for makes positive contributions to charitable organizations or you spend time volunteering for important causes, you may feel good about yourself because your actions and values align. How can you transform a challenging experience into a positive lesson and opportunity for growth? Identifying challenges that you face may typically make you feel uneasy or doubt your abilities, but consider how you may feel if you turn this experience into a positive lesson. Overcoming something difficult can help you grow and develop in your personal and professional life. You may find confidence in your ability to learn something from both positive and negative experiences. What can you do to improve the situations that make you feel nervous? Rather than focusing on circumstances that make you feel nervous or uneasy, consider reflecting on the steps you can take to improve your situation. Consider how you can change the situation for yourself and others. This may help you step into a leadership role and feel confident in your ability to be in control of your reaction to unpredictable outcomes. How often do you doubt your capabilities or the capabilities of others? Recognizing your behavioral patterns can help you identify areas of improvement and create sustainable change. If you notice that you frequently doubt yourself and your abilities, consider interrupting those thoughts and replacing them with a positive statement about yourself or another person. Changing the language you use to describe yourself and others can help you feel more confident in your skills. Related: Self-Confidence in the Workplace: Why It's Important and How To Improve It How do you define personal and professional success? Being successful can help you feel confident in your ability to execute tasks or develop new ideas in your personal and professional life. In order to identify these instances, you may benefit from reflecting on how you define success and what it means to you. If you have a clear definition of what you hope to achieve, you may be able to foster an environment that encourages you to grow and meet your individual goals. Who are the people that improve your life? If you find it hard to identify things that you admire about yourself, you may be able to identify positive attributes in others. Consider reflecting on the people that improve your life, and what they do to make you feel happy, appreciated or fulfilled. If you recognize the good in others, you may notice that it becomes easier to recognize positive things about yourself as well. What was the best moment of your day or week? Experiencing joy and excitement may help you feel other positive emotions, including self-reliance and courage. For example, if you recently received positive feedback from your supervisor or reconnected with an old friend, you may feel good about the steps you took to create that situation or opportunity for yourself. Reflecting on positive experiences may help you recognize what gives your life meaning, and make you feel good about who you are as an individual. What is one thing you can do to make yourself proud today? If you're interested in improving your physical fitness or developing a new professional skill, consider one action you can take to becoming closer to achieving your goal. Making yourself proud can impact how you view your capabilities and may encourage you to repeat this behavior in the future. Working towards achieving your aspirations can help you become self-assured and courageous. Do you know anyone that has the type of confidence you hope to have? Finding a mentor or someone to admire can help you identify the kind of person you hope to become and set realistic goals. Think about people you know or celebrities that possess the level of confidence you're interested in developing. Notice what habits have or routines they establish that allow them to achieve their goals, and consider emulating these behaviors. What are three qualities that you hope to possess? Setting and achieving goals can help you recognize your abilities and take pride in the skills that allow you to accomplish new tasks. Consider identifying three qualities you hope to possess and reflect on why they're meaningful to you. You may create a plan to help you develop these attributes and notice yourself feeling more confident as you commit to your personal or professional growth. What are your three favorite qualities about yourself? In addition to identifying who you hope to become, consider reflecting on who you already are, and what you like about yourself. Consider three personal qualities that you like and how they may positively impact people in your personal life or contribute to your professional success. You may focus on aspects of your character and personality, or things you like about the way you look, speak or feel. What daily practice can you perform to boost your confidence? One way to improve your self-esteem is to commit to a daily routine that encourages your growth and development. Consider one action you can take every morning that makes you feel good about yourself and notice whether this impacts how you feel for the rest of the day. While you may hope to execute one big task to increase your confidence, completing a small daily task may have a more sustainable effect. What are you looking forward to? If you have an important ceremony, exciting holiday or inspiring ceremony in the future, consider focusing your energy on this upcoming event. Recognize what you're looking forward to and why this situation makes you feel good. For example, if you're attending a wedding ceremony where you plan to deliver a speech, you may find confidence in your ability to address a large group of people and inspire them with your words. How have you overcome one of your fears? Recall an instance where you overcame a fear, such as interviewing for a position you weren't sure you'd receive or speaking to your supervisor about a concern. Reflect on how this process went, and what you did to contribute to its success, or how you handled rejection. Regardless of the outcome of the situation, thinking about your resiliency and ability to confront a challenging situation may help you feel courageous and self-assured. What can you say to a close friend or family member that struggles with their self-esteem? If you're unsure how to increase your own feeling of confidence, consider what you may say to a close friend or family member that experiences the same feelings. Think about the positive attributes you can highlight about them, and how you may be able to increase their self-esteem. You can then take these thoughts or feelings and consider what a friend might admire about you. What are you grateful for? You may be able to cultivate confidence by identifying the things and people that you're grateful for and take pride in your ability to facilitate positive experiences or surround yourself with good people. Gratitude may allow you to recognize the events and opportunities you've had, and notice times when others offered you support or guidance. Finding positive situations in your life may increase your self-esteem by highlighting times when others trusted you or saw your potential. Related: How To Build Self-Confidence in 7 Steps Additional questions to consider Here's a list of other questions you can consider when looking to improve your self-confidence: Why are you important to the people in your life? What would you be capable of if you had the confidence you desired? What songs can you listen to in order to boost your mood? Think about a time you disregarded or ignored a compliment. What would it have been like to accept it and thank the person who gave it to you? Consider a time you achieved personal or professional success. How did you feel? How can you turn your weaknesses into strengths? What are the differences between your thoughts and your actions? What steps can you take today to improve your tomorrow? What quotes or phrases inspire you? How can you identify yourself as a leader?

            "Positive Self Esteem Questions You Should Be Asking - Theo J Ellis Theo J Ellis Explore Search Blog About Message Positive Self Esteem Questions You Should Be Asking Home » Positive Self Esteem Questions You Should Be Asking Positive Self Esteem Questions The right perspective makes the impossible possible. – Unknown Changing the way you look at things, as well as the questions and statements you make will make a huge impact to your self esteem. If done right, followed, and done with consistency and 100% commitment. Here are some positive self esteem questions for you to start asking yourself. Each question will spark better answers, and help you overcome your challenges as a result. 1. How can I surround myself with people who encourage me? Birds of a feather REALLY do flock together. The problems with self esteem starts with the flock of birds you’re surrounding yourself with. Or the lack of the right flock of birds you’re surrounding yourself with. Start writing down answers to this question, then figure out HOW you’re going to start meeting and surrounding yourself with encouraging people. How others treat you makes a big difference to how much self esteem you have, and how you feel within your own skin. So this question is a crucial first step! 2. What activities make me feel good about myself? Activities that make ME feel good about myself are writing, contribution, helping others, and exercising. Self esteem is all about how you FEEL about yourself, and how comfortable you are in your own skin. So write down all the answers that come to your mind, and figure out what activities make you feel better and more confident within your own skin. Do that, and you’ll be one step closer to raising your self esteem higher than it is. 3. What inspirational celebrities have overcome their self esteem issues? Inspiration is an ingredient none of us should be without. And that’s the purpose of asking this question. By looking at celebrities who’ve overcome their self esteem issues, especially celebrities you’re fond of, you’ll be inspired to take action and make personal changes. Seeing others do the thing we want to do ourselves, gives us the courage, self belief, and lets us know that what we’re trying to accomplish is possible. 4. What positive habits can I develop to improve my self esteem? Everything we do on a daily basis, regardless of self esteem, is because of our daily habits. What you do everyday effects the outcomes of the actions you take in every area of your life. Here are a couple of positive habits you can develop to boost your self esteem. Positive affirmations What you tell yourself everyday is an affirmation. And what you affirm is what you end up believing and becoming. These affirmations should be useful to you: I’m overcoming my self esteem issues. I do things that make me feel good about myself. I’m more than worth it. I Intend to surround myself with uplifting people. I don’t need anybody’s approval to feel good about myself. Celebrate your accomplishments It’s so easy to accomplish things and never acknowledge our successes, achievements, and our skills and talents. But when you acknowledge and celebrate your wins, only then do you recognize what it is you’re capable of doing. Knowing what you’re capable of and knowing you’re good enough to do it makes you feel good about yourself. And rightly so. So celebrate each win you have, regardless of how big or small it is. Go to a restaurant and eat out, eat junk food, take a short break, go out of town, or anything else you’d consider fun and worth doing to celebrate. It’ll make a big difference to your self esteem overtime. 5. When do I feel most comfortable in my own skin? Similar to question 2, this is about self awareness. And finding out when you feel most comfortable and confident within your own skin. If you have to, ask friends and family. Ask those closest to you. Ask whoever you trust, and whoever you believe will tell you the 100% truth. And don’t forget to pay attention to your habits, your days, and how certain things make you feel throughout the days and weeks. The more you know about yourself, the easier it is to do the right things that’ll help you raise your self esteem, instead of crushing it.

            "Interview – Body Image and Self Esteem Skip to content Twitter Search Search for: Research Practices in Media and Communication (BCM210) Interview – Body Image and Self Esteem For our research task my group has decided to focus on body image and how low self-esteem comes about in both men and women. We’ve decided to particularly look into how low self-esteem comes about through media (magazines, television, advertising). As we’re focusing on this we’ve compiled questions that will analyse how the people partaking in the survey can rank how media may affect them. We can get an average idea of how men and women differ when it comes to how consuming media negatively affects them. Then we have broader questions to elicit a more detailed response from individuals. The closed questions allow us to gather some definite answers whereas the open-ended questions mean we can discover more in depth angles of the issue. The closed questions are set out in the style of ‘multiple choice’ that any participants will be easily able to answer. I practiced some of the more open-ended questions on friends to see how successful they might be. The questions include things like: Can you describe a time you have felt self-conscious due to portrayals of body image in the media? Did it make you feel inclined to change yourself? In what way? If you could change the way women are portrayed in the media, how would you? Do you think men are equally objectified in the media? Do you think because of the media there is a specific definition of ‘perfection’ that most people want to achieve? During asking these questions to friends and family I got the responses that I expected and they had the intended effect – being that most people are made to feel self-conscious by standards held in the media. I think we as a group need to just refine the questions and figure out what issues within body image we want to target and make sure our questions remain simple so that they don’t confuse any participants taking the survey. I feel that our topic and final questions will be really good and result in an interesting study. It’s a topic I’m really passionate about so I’m looking forward to the real thing and seeing the responses from other people in our course. When asking questions around body image and low self-esteem I think it’s also interesting to look into how it stems from family and peer pressure so I think our group may organise some questions surrounding that as well. I feel this topic is very relevant today as we are surrounded by images of perfectionism is and are made to believe we should all look a certain way to be considered perfect. It’s an especially current issue in our generation because of social media and the internet which increases more ideals of how people should look.

            "Body Image Booster: Ask Yourself These 23 Questions PsychCentral Subscribe Body Image Booster: Ask Yourself These 23 Questions Written by Margarita Tartakovsky, MS on August 27, 2012 Every Monday features a tip, activity, inspiring quote or some other tidbit that helps boost your body image, whether directly or indirectly and hopefully kick-starts the week on a positive note! Got a tip for improving body image? Email me at mtartakovsky at gmail dot com, and Ill be happy to feature it. Id love to hear from you! Recently, I read a great quote from Albert Einstein in Tina Seeling’s book InGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity: “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” In other words, questions are key. Asking the right questions helps us identify the best solutions. Asking the right questions helps us challenge ourselves and make powerful changes. In other words, the questions you ask yourself can help you boost your body image, sharpen your self-care practices and best respond to your needs. Here’s a list of 23 questions to help you check in with yourself and build a more positive body image. ( Cheryl Richardson includes a helpful list of self-care questions in her book The Art of Extreme Self-Care: Transform Your Life One Month at a Time . Below, a few of the questions are based on her list.) If my body could talk right now, what would it say? What do I need right now? What’s one way I can celebrate my body every day? What’s something that makes me feel worse about my body? (e.g., women’s magazines, diet books, keeping a scale at home.) What people make me feel bad about my body and myself? Why? What people make me feel better about my body and myself? Why? What helps me to feel comfortable in my own skin? What doesn’t? What do I need to feel nourished, energized and strong? What helps me deal with stress in a healthy way? What has my body helped me do in the last few days? What helps me express my emotions effectively? What are the bare essentials I need to feel good? What can I eliminate from my life that doesn’t make me feel good? What are my favorite ways to move my body? What brings me joy? What does a positive body image mean to me? What does it look like? What does self-love mean to me? What does it look like? How can I make my home a self-care sanctuary ? What can I give myself permission for today ? If I don’t have much time to tend to myself today, what can I do in 15 minutes to nourish myself ? If you’d like, write down the questions that resonate with you, and ask them on a daily or weekly basis. Check in with yourself. See what you need. See what feels energizing and wonderful. See what’s not serving you anymore. See what makes you feel strong and empowered. See what brings you joy. What other questions can you ask yourself to boost your body image?

Reflecting on daily experiences, relationships, and personal values can help you get in better touch with your thoughts and feelings. “I can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn,” wrote Anne Frank, who kept a now-famous account of her daily life and dreams for the future while in hiding during the Holocaust. A journal also offers a safe space to express difficult emotions, making it easier to work through distressing thoughts that you might struggle to share out loud. Are you interested in giving journaling a try? Do you feel a bit stuck when it comes to getting started? Try the 64 prompts below to kick-start your creativity and write your way toward well-being. How to use journal prompts You can certainly learn more about yourself by reviewing what you do each day, but journaling often goes beyond keeping a log of daily events. Journal prompts offer specific themes and topics to reflect on, which can be helpful when you: want to make writing a habit but never know what to write about have a lot of conflicting thoughts to sort through feel as if you could write all day and want help narrowing your focus Some prompts can even help you collect your thoughts on a recent conflict with a friend or partner. For example, writing about specific relationship challenges can help you get more clarity on your emotional needs and how to make sure they’re met. Journaling generally proves most helpful when you do it regularly, though you don’t necessarily need to write every single day. If you’re short on time, you might aim for 3 days each week and pick one prompt to write about each day. Journal prompts for self-discovery and self-reflection We’ve organized these prompts into categories that focus on relationships, emotions, how you feel about work, and more. Love and relationships Having strong, supportive relationships can help improve overall well-being, protect against mental health concerns like depression , and boost resilience , which refers to your ability to weather life’s many challenges. Writing about relationships with loved ones provides the opportunity to: explore the ways these bonds strengthen you express your gratitude for loved ones recognize when relationships no longer serve you explore what you want out of future relationships Consider giving these prompts a try: Who do you trust most? Why? What are your strengths in relationships (kindness, empathy, etc.)? How do you draw strength from loved ones? What do you value most in relationships (trust, respect, sense of humor, etc.)? What three important things have you learned from previous relationships? What five traits do you value most in potential partners? How do you show compassion to others? How can you extend that same compassion to yourself? What are three things working well in your current relationship? What are three things that could be better? What boundaries could you set in your relationships to safeguard your own well-being? What do you most want your children (or future children) to learn from you? How can you better support and appreciate your loved ones? What does love mean to you? How do you recognize it in a relationship? List three things you’d like to tell a friend, family member, or partner. Work and career If you work full-time, you spend the majority of your waking hours on the job. That makes your career a pretty significant part of your life. Having a fulfilling job can promote a sense of purpose and satisfaction with life. On the other hand, having a job that demands too much of you or fails to utilize your unique talents can wear you down and lead to burnout. Taking some time to explore your current career can help highlight what you enjoy about your job and when it might be time to pursue a change. Here are some prompts to consider: How do you use your personal strengths and abilities at work? How do your co-workers and supervisors recognize your strengths? How does work fulfill you? Does it leave you wanting more? What part of your workday do you most enjoy? What about your work feels real, necessary, or important to you? Do you see yourself in the same job in 10 years? What are your career ambitions? What three things can help you begin working to accomplish those goals? What can you do to improve your work performance? What does your work teach you? Does it offer continued opportunities for learning and growth? Does your work drain or overwhelm you? Why? Is this something you can change? Self-reflection Exploring your values, opinions, and personality traits in writing can teach you more about who you are as a person. This in-depth reflection can strengthen not just the relationship you have with yourself, but also the connections you build with others. Some ideas to explore include: What values do you consider most important in life (honesty, justice, altruism, loyalty, etc.)? How do your actions align with those values? What three changes can you make to live according to your personal values? Describe yourself using the first 10 words that come to mind. Then, list 10 words that you’d like to use to describe yourself. List a few ways to transform those descriptions into reality. What do you appreciate most about your personality? What aspects do you find harder to accept? Explore an opinion or two that you held in the past but have since questioned or changed. What led you to change that opinion? List three personal beliefs that you’re willing to reconsider or further explore. Finish this sentence: “My life would be incomplete without …” Describe one or two significant life events that helped shape you into who you are today. When do you trust yourself most? When do you find it harder to have faith in your instincts? What three things would you most like others (loved ones, potential friends and partners, professional acquaintances, etc.) to know about you? Uncomfortable emotions Journaling can help you express and begin to navigate difficult and painful emotions. That’s part of what makes it such a valuable exercise. Burying unwanted emotions and thoughts can seem helpful at first. Pushing those feelings away means you avoid the pain and discomfort they cause, right? Not always. In reality, avoiding emotional distress can intensify it . That pain lies dormant below the surface of your everyday thoughts until you can’t keep it back any longer. When it finally comes bubbling up, it may feel more overwhelming than it did originally. These prompts can help you explore and process challenging emotions productively: What difficult thoughts or emotions come up most frequently for you? Which emotions do you find hardest to accept (guilt, anger, disappointment, etc.)? How do you handle these emotions? Describe a choice you regret. What did you learn from it? What parts of daily life cause stress, frustration, or sadness? What can you do to change those experiences? What are three things that can instantly disrupt a good mood and bring you down? What strategies do you use to counter these effects? What are three self-defeating thoughts that show up in your self-talk? How can you reframe them to encourage yourself instead? What go-to coping strategies help you get through moments of emotional or physical pain? Who do you trust with your most painful and upsetting feelings? How can you connect with them when feeling low? What do you fear most? Have your fears changed throughout life? Note: If writing about painful emotions makes you feel even worse, there’s no need to push yourself. It may help to establish a regular journaling habit before you turn to more challenging topics. Living your best life Writing about the little things that add meaning to daily life makes it easier to notice just how much they boost your mood and overall well-being. Recognizing what you enjoy most about life reminds you to keep making time for those things. It can also promote feelings of gratitude and contentment, as exploring what you love about life can help you realize that you may already have much of what you desire. Here are some prompts to try: Describe your favorite thing to do when feeling low. What three ordinary things bring you the most joy? List three strategies that help you stay present in your daily routines. Then, list three strategies to help boost mindfulness in your life. How do you prioritize self-care? Describe two or three things you do to relax. What aspects of your life are you most grateful for? How do you show yourself kindness and compassion each day? Write a short love letter to some object or place that makes you happy. What place makes you feel most peaceful? Describe that place using all five senses. List 10 things that inspire or motivate you. What are your favorite hobbies? Why? Personal growth and life goals Getting in touch with who you are now doesn’t just help you recognize key strengths and values. It can also help unlock a deeper understanding of who you want to become and what you want from life. As long as you live, you can continue to pursue change and growth. Try these prompts to explore your dreams and outline potential paths toward change: What parts of life surprised you most? What turned out the way you expected it would? What three things would you share with your teenage self? What three questions would you want to ask an older version of yourself? List three important goals. How do they match up to your goals from 5 years ago? Do your goals truly reflect your desires? Or do they reflect what someone else (a parent, partner, friend, etc.) wants for you? What helps you stay focused and motivated when you feel discouraged? What do you look forward to most in the future? Identify one area where you’d like to improve. Then, list three specific actions you can take to create that change. How do you make time for yourself each day? What do you most want to accomplish in life? List three obstacles lying in the way of your contentment or happiness. Then, list two potential solutions to begin overcoming each obstacle. Feeling stuck? If you’ve never kept a journal before, writing on a regular basis might feel a bit challenging. Even with prompts to help prime your thoughts, you might find it tough to get started. The best way to start is to pick up your pen and start scribbling away. Your journal is just for you, so there’s no need to worry about your handwriting, grammar, or spelling. The important part of journaling is getting your thoughts onto the page. Some people find that it helps to start with a “stream of consciousness” approach. This means writing down whatever comes to mind on a topic, exactly as it pops into your thoughts, without stopping to worry about punctuation or complete sentences. A few more tips to help you find your flow include: Find a quiet place to write. Outside noise and other distractions can disrupt your thoughts, especially if you’re new to journaling. If you can’t find a quiet space, try listening to instrumental music (anything without vocals) as you write. Don’t worry about getting it “right.” When it comes to journaling, you can’t really go wrong. If your writing helps you process emotions and learn more about yourself, that’s what matters. Write regularly. You might set aside 15 or 20 minutes to write several days a week. It’s OK if you can’t find time to write every day. Writing at a specific time each day, such as after dinner or just before bed, can help the habit stick. Next steps Journaling can help ease stress and uncertainty and teach you more about yourself and what you want from life. That said, writing may not always feel fun or easy. It’s normal to experience a little discomfort when writing about painful emotions and frustrating experiences. But venting this distress can often lead to healing and growth. When your writing continues to bring up distressing feelings or memories, a therapist can offer guidance with exploring these emotions and experiences in more depth.

Back Free resources Deals and offers Recommendations My equipment Cart 0 About Blog membership Newsletter Resources Free resources Deals and offers Recommendations My equipment Podcast Course Book! 75 Journaling Prompts for Your Best Life Journaling is so underrated. I do think it has been getting more attention lately as the powerful life tool that it is rather than just a “here’s what I did today” personal record type thing. However, I don’t think I’ll be satisfied until everyone journals, haha, because I simply cannot imagine my life without it. Why I started journaling (and kept it up) So why did I start journaling? Well, I did it on and off in the beginning. I think I was in my early teens or tweens when I started (hehe, tweens, I still think that’s a funny term). I journaled because I wanted to record the memories of my life. I also wanted to be cute and artsy and have doodles and weather trackers and music playlists and lists and photos and tickets stubs… Which is all fun and good except these weren’t reasons that were ever able to suck me in and keep me going with the journaling habit. In no more than a few weeks, it would start feeling like a chore. I’d groan about having to expound on every last detail of my day. At some point in high school, I picked journaling back up but in a totally low-pressure way. I returned to my journal when I had something I wanted to say. And then, I got hooked. I didn’t even have to remind myself to write. My journal was always in reach and I was consistently drawn to it because I wanted to get my thoughts down on paper. As I developed a morning and an evening routine (which by the way have changed my life just as much as journaling has), journaling slotted seamlessly into them. I started developing a bit of a template for my writing, because I started to get a good idea of what worked. In the evening, I write down three “wins” from the day, three things I was grateful for, and one improvement I want to make the next day. In the morning, I write down three things I’m looking forward to and recommit to the improvement. In the main body of my writing, I discuss whatever I want. Sometimes it’s what I did that day, sometimes it’s just a random collection of thoughts, ideas, worries, self pep-talks , etc. Guys. I know I get excited about a lot of things on this blog but I am not exaggerating when I say that writing these simple things is INCREDIBLY powerful. It basically reprograms your thoughts. You learn so much about yourself and how your mind works. You start and end each day positively.  Keep reading for 75 FREE journal prompts and a printable to go along with it!  Make journaling a habit If you don’t already journal, please, please consider starting . You don’t even need a fancy notebook (although that can be a fun motivator if that’s in your budget). Start small and with minimal expectations so as to not overwhelm yourself. Perhaps a few sentences about how your day went and three things you were grateful for. Track the habit to create a pattern. Try “habit stacking”, which is basically tying the journaling habit to a habit you already do to make it easier to implement. For example, I incorporated journaling easily into my morning and evening routines. 75 prompts Once you’re ready to write more, don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. I don’t just have you covered. I have you 100% SET. 75 prompts, all of which you could probably write anywhere from a few sentences to a few pages about. It’s all up to you. Some of these prompts ask you to look forward to or look back at the day. But what if you’re journaling in the morning and the prompt is “what are 3 things you accomplished today?”. Just write about what you accomplished yesterday :) Make these yours, there are no rules! I would also like to mention that a lot of these are great introductions to improvements you can make in your life. For example, one prompt asks you to reflect on what clothing in your closet you love the most and which items fail to inspire you. You can use that as a jumpstart to cleaning out your closet and updating your wardrobe! By taking a few minutes to journal and think hard about it, you are getting the hardest part out of the way, basically. Write down a few little memories from this week that made you smile that you would have otherwise forgotten. Write a letter to a person in your life that you have found to be draining of your energy.  Avoid excessive negativity - simply say goodbye to them and focus on committing yourself to spending more time with people who give you energy. What is a task(s) you keep scheduling and rescheduling that you could just take off your plate altogether? Consider that if you keep not getting it done, it might not be of value to you. What is something you want to do but haven’t yet because of fear? Might you be over-exaggerating that fear? How can you overcome it? What do you wish you didn’t have to do today? Write about why it won’t be as bad as you expect it to be and how you’ll feel once you’re done. What are your absolute favorite items in your closet? Conversely, what are some items you find yourself rarely wearing or feeling uninspired by? When do you feel like you rush too much? How could you slow down and enjoy the process? What makes you feel cozy and safe? What qualities in other people bother/annoy you? How can you strive to make sure you don’t embody those qualities? What is something you are involved in (like volunteering, a side project, or an extracurricular) that doesn’t feel like work at all to you? Why is that? A good prompt for when you’re getting ready for bed, especially if you feel like you need to calm yourself before going to sleep: outline your bedtime ritual, write about how relaxed you feel, and how comfy you will feel once you are in your bed. What opportunities have come your way recently that you are grateful for? How did you open yourself up to those opportunities/take advantage of them? What is a goal that you are currently working on and who is someone who could help you with that? What could you ask them for? Make a gratitude list. The power of gratitude cannot be overstated, in my opinion. Make a list of 10 things, 50, a 100!! Go crazy. What is a challenge that you have overcome recently that you need to give yourself credit for? What are some skills you have always wanted to learn or topics you have wanted to explore? Who is someone in your life you appreciate at the moment? Write to them. What task has been weighing on your mind lately? Make a plan to prioritize it and get it done today. What are 3 things you accomplished today (or yesterday) that you are proud of and need to pat yourself on the back for? 3 things I am looking forward to today are… What is your fashion style? You might have a Pinterest board filled with clothes/outfits you like, but try summarizing your style in words. This could help you when shopping! They say you’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Who are those 5 people for you and what qualities do you think you have adopted from them? How do you feel when you challenge your body? Really describe that rush of endorphins you feel, and the satisfaction at the end of a workout. Refer to this whenever you need motivation to exercise! What do you wish you could tell someone about how you feel? Write as if you are conversing with them. What would be your ideal location to live in? City, suburbs, or out in the country? House or apartment? Having to drive a car everywhere or being able to walk places? Where in the world? What are the most used apps on your phone? What value do they add to your life? What are the least used apps? How about the apps you use a lot but consider to be a distraction? Could you part with them? What are some comfortable aspects of your life that you sometimes take for granted? Use your writing to appreciate them fully. When in the day do you feel you are able to work best? When are you most motivated? How can you arrange your day to maximize those productive window(s)? What are some ways you could spend quality time with family and friends in the upcoming month? Brainstorm ideas and then commit to scheduling those. If you had unlimited money/resources/connections/whatever, what gifts would you give to the people you appreciate in your life? Get creative :) What topics do you feel like an expert on? It doesn’t have to be anything academic. Maybe you could talk for hours about a band you like, or about different kinds of eyeshadow. Celebrate your knowledge! Write down anything and everything you can think of to describe your dream life. What are you doing? What do you have? What have you accomplished? Don’t judge what you are writing down, just let the ideas flow. What is something you currently desire? (an opportunity, an experience, a material item, it really doesn’t matter) Get clear on it and ask the universe for it (yes, straight up ask , you might feel silly, but this is the basis of manifestation) Who is someone in your life you would like to spend more time with? What are some ways you could do that? When you think about your future, are you excited or scared? Which aspects exactly are you excited/scared about? Do you prefer being outdoors or indoors? Feel free to say “it depends” and list all of the conditions that would go into your decision :) What is something you would improve about how today went? Use positive language and don’t beat yourself up about it. Rather, find joy in anticipating a better day now that you have acknowledged that you have room for improvement and are going to make that change. Make a small list of things you are good at and/or passionate about and brainstorm ways that you could make money off of those things. How can you surpass your own expectations today? What are some ways you can go above and beyond what you have planned for yourself to accomplish? How would you describe your relationship with your phone/other technology in your life? What never fails to motivate you and get you pumped up? A certain song, a power pose, an inspirational video? How would you describe the mood you are in right now? Make a playlist for that mood. You can definitely do this quite easily on your phone but try to stick to paper to minimize distractions! Choose an affirmation that feels right for the day and write it ten times while saying it out loud to get it in your head. What is something you need to forgive yourself for? Write it down and leave it in the past. What are some ways you would like to serve your community in the near future? What are some areas of your life in which you are too harsh with yourself? Write down some loving statements to show acceptance of where you currently are in your life. What does having your “soul on fire” mean to you? What sets your soul on fire? What are some things you do simply because that is the “path” that is set out for you? Are those things really adding value to your life? What are 5 lessons you have learned in this past week? Life is full of lessons and it is helpful to write them down, no matter how small they may be. Looking through your journal can be helpful for finding these lessons. What are some habits you would like to incorporate into your routines? How would they improve your life and how could you get started? If you could only accomplish three things today, what would be the most important items on your to-do list? (setting priorities is a great thing to practice every day!) What is an area of your life that could use more organization? Ex. your closet, your bathroom cabinet, your photos and videos, your schedule, etc. Is there a time this week that you could dedicate to working on that? What is your favorite way to start the day? What makes you feel energized and peaceful? Make a travel bucket list. Describe the things you would like to see/experience in each place to make it feel more tangible and get you excited. What relationships are you looking for in life? Doesn’t have to be a romantic relationship. Maybe you are looking for a friendship that you feel is lacking in your life, or a mentor figure. Describe that. Write down a few things you appreciate about your parents, your siblings, etc. It’s easy to forget these because we usually have spent so much time with our families. What is something that makes you uncomfortable in a good way? How could you do more of that? Make a list of habits you already do and celebrate your commitment to those habits. How have they improved your life? What are your priorities? Do you think how you spend your days is in tune with those priorities? Challenge: The word priorities is innately an oxymoron. There can only be one true priority. What is your one priority in life, if you had to choose? Write a letter to someone you really admire. It could be someone you personally know or maybe someone you have never met, a public figure, perhaps. What have you learned from them? How have they inspired you? Do you consider yourself to be spontaneous or more of a planner? Would you like to be more of either? What are some compliments you have wanted to give someone but have been too shy to? What are your 3 favorite qualities about yourself? What is a big project that has intimidated you for a while and what is the one simplest step you can think of that will help you advance in that project? What 3 words would you use to describe your dream life? Explain. Write them down somewhere, maybe even set them as your phone wallpaper! Make a life bucket list. Don’t hold back. You can edit later if you want but let your imagination run wild for a few minutes. Where would you travel to if you had unlimited money and time? Describe the trip in detail. Choose a mantra that you want to keep with you for a while. This is great at the beginning of a new year or month but works whenever you decide to do it. For example, my mantra for 2018 is “err on the side of action*. What do other people admire you for? Do you accept those compliments or push them away? 5 things I am looking forward to this week… The age-old “get to know you” question that tends to make people nervous: What are your hobbies? Don’t worry, you are just writing this for yourself. What do you do in your free time that you truly enjoy? Write a letter to yourself in 5 years. Tell them about your life currently and express the dreams you hope to reach in 5 years. Describe your ideal day, from waking up to going to sleep. How do you undervalue yourself? In what situations do you ask for too little when deep down you know you are worth more than that? Do you prefer spending time alone or with other people? In what situations do you feel you gain energy? Does it depend? Next steps Of course I had to make a cute printable out of this, hehe. So go ahead and download this PDF to keep the prompts handy with you. That way you won’t have to pull out your phone or computer to view them. Bam, distraction minimized.

Just like it sounds, morning journaling is the practice of writing in a journal every morning before you start your day. It doesn't have to be anything special or fancy. Your journal is a private place for you to come as you are, and write whatever you're feeling. This is why journaling is a great way to process your thoughts. When we write things down, we are forced to articulate what we're feeling - no matter how confusing - in an organized way. This can give you a new perspective on anything that has been troubling you, and help clear your head. â â â Give morning journaling a try if: You dread getting up in the morning You start your day feeling stressed or anxious You want to feel calmer and more present You want more motivation throughout the day Another reason to try morning journaling? All the best writers do it. A famous book by Julia Cameron, The Artist's Way, recommends \"morning pages\" as a daily practice for creatives. Morning pages are 3 full pages of hand-written, stream of consciousness thoughts written as soon as you wake up. This practice caught on with creatives all over the world. It has been said to boost creativity, shed negativity, and clarify goals. Master setting &Â achieving goals with journaling â â Tips on how to do Morning Journaling For the fullest effect, make morning journaling a ritual. Maybe you want to sit down with a cup of coffee or your breakfast, and write at your kitchen table. Or maybe you want to write while cozy in bed before you get up. Whatever you choose, consistency is key. Writing in the same place, at the same time every day can help solidify morning journaling as part of your daily routine.

However, one of the obstacles that people face when they want to pick up the practice of journaling is that they don’t know what to write about. In this post you’ll discover 119 journal prompts to help you get started in keeping a journal, or as additional inspiration for dedicated journalers. I recommend that you do the following: Get a beautiful jar–it can be a canning jar, a mason jar, or any other jar you have in the house. Print out the prompts below on slips of paper. Place the slips of paper in the jar. Reach into your jar each day as you prepare to write in your journal and take out one of the prompts. Set your timer anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes, depending on how much time you have available for journaling. Write anything that comes to mind as you read each prompt and elaborate on each point as much as you can. Below you’ll find 119 journal prompts for your journal jar. Sunday Scribblings Sunday Scribblings is a site that posts a writing prompt every Saturday. The idea is that on Sunday you create a piece of writing inspired by the prompt, post it on your blog, and leave a comment on the “Sunday Scribblings” site letting them know that you’ve participated. These can also be used as journal prompts. Here are some of their prompts: What scares you? Do you have a plan? Do you need a plan? Have you had a plan fall spectacularly to pieces? What is your take on soul mates? Are you a worrier? Is there a particular worry that you can’t shake? How do you cope with worry? Dear Past Me . . . Dear Future Me . . . Create Lists You can create lists of many things, such as the following: Places you’ve enjoyed visiting. Things you’ve done that you previously thought you could never do. The people you most admire. Your favorite books. Your favorite movies. Your favorite songs. Your top five short term goals. Your top five long term goals. As a bonus, here’s an infographic with 60 lists to make when you need to lift your mood (you can download a PDF with these 60 list ideas at the end of this blog post). Confessions Do you have anything you would like to confess (even if it’s just to the pages of your journal)? Nobody knows that I . . . Dear ____, it weighs on me that I never told you . . . The biggest lie I’ve ever told is . . . Is there anything you feel guilty about?  Is there anything you need to be forgiven for? What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? What’s your secret desire? What’s the most outrageous thing you’ve ever done? Use Quotes as Journal Prompts Look at the following quotes and write whatever comes to mind when you read them: “If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches.” — Rilke “I have always imagined that Paradise will be some kind of library.” — Jorge Luis Borges “Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family.  Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.” — Jane Howard “What in your life is calling you? When all the noise is silenced, the meetings adjourned, the lists laid aside, and the wild iris blooms by itself in the dark forest, what still pulls on your soul? In the silence between your heartbeats hides a summons, do you hear it? Name it, if you must, or leave it forever nameless, but why pretend it is not there?” — The Terma Collective “Art is when you hear a knocking from your soul and you answer.”  Star Richés The Most . . . The most terrifying moment of my life was . . . The most fun I’ve ever had . . . The most surprised I’ve ever been . . . The most disappointed I’ve ever been . . . What are you looking forward to the most? Visual Journaling Prompts Leaf through a couple of magazines and cut out any images that catch your attention.  Use each one as a prompt. Look through your photographs and choose a few to write about. Buy art books that are at a discount and cut them up for images. Three Things Three things you can’t go without. Three celebrity crushes. Three favorite book characters. Three favorite things to wear. Three things you want in a relationship. If you had to evacuate your home because of a natural disaster, what three things would you take with you? Three pet peeves. Three things you’d do if you weren’t so afraid. Three favorite TV shows. 100 Things I Love You’re going to make lists that will add up to 100 things you love.  Make sure you give an explanation for each of the things you add to your list.  For example, don’t just list your favorite restaurants, write down what you enjoy about each one (the warm bread they serve before the meal, the waiter who always remembers your favorite dish, the whimsical decor, and so on). 10 Activities 10 Restaurants 10 People 10 Foods 10 Games 6 Drinks/Beverages 4 Desserts 10 Paintings 10 Web Sites 10 Writers 10 Famous lines from books/movies Express Your Emotions My saddest memory is  . . . Some of the things that make me happy are . . . How do you deal with anger? How easy is it for you to forgive those who have caused you pain? What is the dominant emotion in your life right now? Rituals and Traditions My favorite Sunday ritual . . . The Holiday traditions I most look forward to . . . Things I always did with my dad when I was small . . . Things I always did with my mom when I was little . . . Ask “If” Questions These prompts were inspired by the book If… (Questions For The Game of Life) . If you could have dinner with anyone currently alive, who would it be? If you could meet any fictional character, who would it be? If you could change one thing about your present life, what would it be? If you could live anywhere you wanted, where would you live? If you could go back in time and change one things from your past, what would it be? Memories From Your Childhood What was your favorite toy? Did you ever get lost?

Who was your favorite teacher? What’s your first memory? What was your favorite cartoon? What book did you read over and over again as a child? What is your most vivid memory of the kitchen in your childhood? As a child, who was your favorite relative? Thinking of the Week That Just Ended Who made you feel good this week? What was the biggest mistake you made this week? What did you do this week that moved you closer to reaching your goals? Is there anything you did this week that you wish you’d done differently? What did you most enjoy doing this week? How did you procrastinate on important tasks this week? What did you learn this week? What’s the funniest thing that happened to you this week? Write a Letter Write a letter to someone you need to forgive. Write a letter to someone who believed in you even when you didn’t believe in yourself. Write a letter to be read by each of your loved ones after you’ve passed away. Write a fan letter to your favorite actor/actress. Write a letter to the editor of your favorite magazine telling them what features you would like to see included in the magazine. Is there something you’re reluctant to tell someone?  Write a letter to help y0u organize your thoughts. Landmark Events Write about your first dance. Write about your first crush. Write about your first week in college. Write about your first job. Write about the first apartment you ever rented. When did you feel truly independent for the first time? The Sky’s the Limit What would you do if you knew you could not fail? What would you do if money were no object? What would you ask for if a genie granted you three wishes? What’s your wildest dream? What would you do if you could live a day without consequences? What grand adventure do you wish you could go on? If you could become an expert in any subject or activity, what would it be? What would your perfect day be like? Close your eyes and imagine the kind of world you would like to see.  What is it like? An Ode To Your Uniqueness What makes you unique? How do you stand out from the crowd? What are your best character traits? What are you really good at? How would you describe yourself? How would your best friend describe you? What character traits do you need to work on? What are some of your idiosyncrasies? How do you indulge yourself?  Do you need to indulge yourself more often? How do you think others see you when they meet you for the first time? Dream Triggers Use your journaling sessions to think about your ideal life. Ask yourself dream triggers, such as the following: How would you like to make this world a better place? How can you best share your gifts with the world? What qualities do you want in a romantic partner? What are the top ten characteristics that you look for in a romantic partner? What are the top ten qualities a friend should have (treats people with respect; listens but doesn’t judge; has a quirky sense of humor; is an artist; lives with passion; doesn’t sweat the small stuff; is loyal and trustworthy)? What would make you feel spiritually fulfilled? What famous world festivals would you like to attend? You’ll find 1000 dream triggers, covering 10 different life areas, here . Memory Triggers My eBook, “Create Your Life Story” , contains 444 memory prompts, covering several life areas, to help you get started recording your memories and writing your life story. They can also be used as journaling prompts. Here are three of the prompts that you’ll find inside: Was there anything noteworthy about your mother’s upbringing –she grew up in extreme poverty or extreme wealth; she grew up during the Great Depression; she grew up surrounded by artists, philosophers, or politicians; her family moved around a lot when she was growing up; and so on? Write down three of your father’s favorites (it could be his favorite singer, his favorite book or author, his favorite movie, his favorite time of the year, his favorite basketball player, his favorite artist, his favorite meal, his favorite dessert, and so on). Do you have any famous or high profile family members? If so, write about them. Conclusion Keeping a journal is a great tool for changing your life for the better . In addition,  keeping prompts in a journal jar will make journaling easier. The prompts above are a great place to start. As promised above, here’s the PDF with the 60 lists to make when you need a mood lift. Download it, print it, and put it somewhere you can grab it when you feel like making lists.

Jenny August 22, 2012, 2:40 pm Awesome. I Love this! I also had an idea as I read through some of these prompts that I think I’m going to use some of them to do a “get to know you better” game with my siblings. As we are getting older and are now spread so far apart there is so much I’d love to know in a deeper way about them. The easier things I know, but I’d like to ask things from like “The Sky’s the Limit” along with a few other deeper questions. Link Ali Pilgram September 12, 2012, 1:45 pm Hi, I’m 14 and my teacher said we needed to find some journal prompts.

Link Jodi January 11, 2015, 4:00 am Been into keeping a journal since I was 21 in 1987 and found that I am sometimes still in the mood to write even after I’ve already updated my journal with what’s going at the present moment in my life. I think this is a great way to expand those journal horizons, so to speak. Although I’ve probably mentioned most of these things in my journals over the years, it’s nice to have a consolidated and organized theme I can follow such as this. Thanks!

Infringes my copyright Visually pornographic content Hateful or weaponized writing Spam or misleading text Submit Cancel 0 God & Man When we write, we force ourselves to do three really important things: 1. We get our thoughts outside of ourselves, allowing us to see them as independent things. This process separates who we are from what we think, providing us with a bit of space and perspective to process what’s really going on inside our head and heart. 2. We clarify as we force ourselves to form sentences and logical thoughts. Our writing brings flow and a sense of wholeness to the otherwise confusing mess in our minds. When everything is inside, it’s easy to get lost amidst the clutter. It’s easy to feel scattered or all over the place. However, when things are laid out cleanly on a page, we can easily see what fits and where. 3. We think differently. While some questions may seem silly or useless, the process of writing and responding will often take us somewhere unexpected, somewhere new we didn’t know we needed to be. It is precisely by considering different points of view that we are able to leave the confines of our normal life. We can experience new epiphanies and we can bravely see who we truly are. It’s hard to see the picture when we’re living in the frame and sometimes, a subtle nudge or a bit of prompting is all that’s needed to create lasting change. Are you ready to get the words down and let your thoughts out? Pick a random number from 1-50 and spend five minutes every morning with a pen, paper, and these questions: the 50 best journaling prompts you will ever read or need.

What three things could you give up that would give you more time, energy, and peace? What does your ideal day look like? Be specific. What does heroic mean to you, and who are your biggest heroes? What advice would you give yourself five years ago? What do you love most about your life? If you found out that you were going to die tomorrow, what would be your three biggest regrets?

Δ Alexis ash Monday 22nd of February 2021 Me as the teacher just found a journal that I love for my homeschool and in school children. We have them write 10-15 sentences a day. Right now we are on break and I'm teaching my homeschool students. We normally have a homeschool teacher come in and teach my children when i am working. I just want to have a good journal the children. Even sometimes I have to take some kids from school to my house and wait till their parent/guardian to come pick them up. It's a struggle trust me.

I do think it has been getting more attention lately as the powerful life tool that it is rather than just a “here’s what I did today” personal record type thing. However, I don’t think I’ll be satisfied until everyone journals, haha, because I simply cannot imagine my life without it. Why I started journaling (and kept it up) So why did I start journaling? Well, I did it on and off in the beginning. I think I was in my early teens or tweens when I started (hehe, tweens, I still think that’s a funny term). I journaled because I wanted to record the memories of my life. I also wanted to be cute and artsy and have doodles and weather trackers and music playlists and lists and photos and tickets stubs… Which is all fun and good except these weren’t reasons that were ever able to suck me in and keep me going with the journaling habit. In no more than a few weeks, it would start feeling like a chore. I’d groan about having to expound on every last detail of my day. At some point in high school, I picked journaling back up but in a totally low-pressure way. I returned to my journal when I had something I wanted to say. And then, I got hooked. I didn’t even have to remind myself to write. My journal was always in reach and I was consistently drawn to it because I wanted to get my thoughts down on paper. As I developed a morning and an evening routine (which by the way have changed my life just as much as journaling has), journaling slotted seamlessly into them. I started developing a bit of a template for my writing, because I started to get a good idea of what worked. In the evening, I write down three “wins” from the day, three things I was grateful for, and one improvement I want to make the next day. In the morning, I write down three things I’m looking forward to and recommit to the improvement. In the main body of my writing, I discuss whatever I want. Sometimes it’s what I did that day, sometimes it’s just a random collection of thoughts, ideas, worries, self pep-talks , etc. Guys. I know I get excited about a lot of things on this blog but I am not exaggerating when I say that writing these simple things is INCREDIBLY powerful. It basically reprograms your thoughts. You learn so much about yourself and how your mind works. You start and end each day positively.  Keep reading for 75 FREE journal prompts and a printable to go along with it!  Make journaling a habit If you don’t already journal, please, please consider starting . You don’t even need a fancy notebook (although that can be a fun motivator if that’s in your budget). Start small and with minimal expectations so as to not overwhelm yourself. Perhaps a few sentences about how your day went and three things you were grateful for. Track the habit to create a pattern. Try “habit stacking”, which is basically tying the journaling habit to a habit you already do to make it easier to implement. For example, I incorporated journaling easily into my morning and evening routines. 75 prompts Once you’re ready to write more, don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. I don’t just have you covered. I have you 100% SET. 75 prompts, all of which you could probably write anywhere from a few sentences to a few pages about. It’s all up to you. Some of these prompts ask you to look forward to or look back at the day. But what if you’re journaling in the morning and the prompt is “what are 3 things you accomplished today?”. Just write about what you accomplished yesterday :) Make these yours, there are no rules! I would also like to mention that a lot of these are great introductions to improvements you can make in your life. For example, one prompt asks you to reflect on what clothing in your closet you love the most and which items fail to inspire you. You can use that as a jumpstart to cleaning out your closet and updating your wardrobe! By taking a few minutes to journal and think hard about it, you are getting the hardest part out of the way, basically. Write down a few little memories from this week that made you smile that you would have otherwise forgotten. Write a letter to a person in your life that you have found to be draining of your energy.  Avoid excessive negativity - simply say goodbye to them and focus on committing yourself to spending more time with people who give you energy. What is a task(s) you keep scheduling and rescheduling that you could just take off your plate altogether? Consider that if you keep not getting it done, it might not be of value to you. What is something you want to do but haven’t yet because of fear? Might you be over-exaggerating that fear? How can you overcome it? What do you wish you didn’t have to do today? Write about why it won’t be as bad as you expect it to be and how you’ll feel once you’re done. What are your absolute favorite items in your closet? Conversely, what are some items you find yourself rarely wearing or feeling uninspired by? When do you feel like you rush too much? How could you slow down and enjoy the process? What makes you feel cozy and safe? What qualities in other people bother/annoy you? How can you strive to make sure you don’t embody those qualities? What is something you are involved in (like volunteering, a side project, or an extracurricular) that doesn’t feel like work at all to you? Why is that? A good prompt for when you’re getting ready for bed, especially if you feel like you need to calm yourself before going to sleep: outline your bedtime ritual, write about how relaxed you feel, and how comfy you will feel once you are in your bed. What opportunities have come your way recently that you are grateful for? How did you open yourself up to those opportunities/take advantage of them? What is a goal that you are currently working on and who is someone who could help you with that? What could you ask them for? Make a gratitude list. The power of gratitude cannot be overstated, in my opinion. Make a list of 10 things, 50, a 100!! Go crazy. What is a challenge that you have overcome recently that you need to give yourself credit for? What are some skills you have always wanted to learn or topics you have wanted to explore? Who is someone in your life you appreciate at the moment? Write to them. What task has been weighing on your mind lately? Make a plan to prioritize it and get it done today. What are 3 things you accomplished today (or yesterday) that you are proud of and need to pat yourself on the back for? 3 things I am looking forward to today are… What is your fashion style? You might have a Pinterest board filled with clothes/outfits you like, but try summarizing your style in words. This could help you when shopping! They say you’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Who are those 5 people for you and what qualities do you think you have adopted from them? How do you feel when you challenge your body? Really describe that rush of endorphins you feel, and the satisfaction at the end of a workout. Refer to this whenever you need motivation to exercise! What do you wish you could tell someone about how you feel? Write as if you are conversing with them. What would be your ideal location to live in? City, suburbs, or out in the country? House or apartment? Having to drive a car everywhere or being able to walk places? Where in the world? What are the most used apps on your phone? What value do they add to your life? What are the least used apps? How about the apps you use a lot but consider to be a distraction? Could you part with them? What are some comfortable aspects of your life that you sometimes take for granted? Use your writing to appreciate them fully. When in the day do you feel you are able to work best? When are you most motivated? How can you arrange your day to maximize those productive window(s)? What are some ways you could spend quality time with family and friends in the upcoming month? Brainstorm ideas and then commit to scheduling those. If you had unlimited money/resources/connections/whatever, what gifts would you give to the people you appreciate in your life? Get creative :) What topics do you feel like an expert on? It doesn’t have to be anything academic. Maybe you could talk for hours about a band you like, or about different kinds of eyeshadow. Celebrate your knowledge! Write down anything and everything you can think of to describe your dream life. What are you doing? What do you have? What have you accomplished? Don’t judge what you are writing down, just let the ideas flow. What is something you currently desire? (an opportunity, an experience, a material item, it really doesn’t matter) Get clear on it and ask the universe for it (yes, straight up ask , you might feel silly, but this is the basis of manifestation) Who is someone in your life you would like to spend more time with? What are some ways you could do that? When you think about your future, are you excited or scared? Which aspects exactly are you excited/scared about? Do you prefer being outdoors or indoors? Feel free to say “it depends” and list all of the conditions that would go into your decision :) What is something you would improve about how today went? Use positive language and don’t beat yourself up about it. Rather, find joy in anticipating a better day now that you have acknowledged that you have room for improvement and are going to make that change. Make a small list of things you are good at and/or passionate about and brainstorm ways that you could make money off of those things. How can you surpass your own expectations today? What are some ways you can go above and beyond what you have planned for yourself to accomplish? How would you describe your relationship with your phone/other technology in your life? What never fails to motivate you and get you pumped up? A certain song, a power pose, an inspirational video? How would you describe the mood you are in right now? Make a playlist for that mood. You can definitely do this quite easily on your phone but try to stick to paper to minimize distractions! Choose an affirmation that feels right for the day and write it ten times while saying it out loud to get it in your head. What is something you need to forgive yourself for? Write it down and leave it in the past. What are some ways you would like to serve your community in the near future? What are some areas of your life in which you are too harsh with yourself? Write down some loving statements to show acceptance of where you currently are in your life. What does having your “soul on fire” mean to you? What sets your soul on fire? What are some things you do simply because that is the “path” that is set out for you? Are those things really adding value to your life? What are 5 lessons you have learned in this past week? Life is full of lessons and it is helpful to write them down, no matter how small they may be. Looking through your journal can be helpful for finding these lessons. What are some habits you would like to incorporate into your routines? How would they improve your life and how could you get started? If you could only accomplish three things today, what would be the most important items on your to-do list? (setting priorities is a great thing to practice every day!) What is an area of your life that could use more organization? Ex. your closet, your bathroom cabinet, your photos and videos, your schedule, etc. Is there a time this week that you could dedicate to working on that? What is your favorite way to start the day? What makes you feel energized and peaceful? Make a travel bucket list. Describe the things you would like to see/experience in each place to make it feel more tangible and get you excited. What relationships are you looking for in life? Doesn’t have to be a romantic relationship. Maybe you are looking for a friendship that you feel is lacking in your life, or a mentor figure. Describe that. Write down a few things you appreciate about your parents, your siblings, etc. It’s easy to forget these because we usually have spent so much time with our families. What is something that makes you uncomfortable in a good way? How could you do more of that? Make a list of habits you already do and celebrate your commitment to those habits. How have they improved your life? What are your priorities? Do you think how you spend your days is in tune with those priorities? Challenge: The word priorities is innately an oxymoron. There can only be one true priority. What is your one priority in life, if you had to choose? Write a letter to someone you really admire. It could be someone you personally know or maybe someone you have never met, a public figure, perhaps. What have you learned from them? How have they inspired you? Do you consider yourself to be spontaneous or more of a planner? Would you like to be more of either? What are some compliments you have wanted to give someone but have been too shy to? What are your 3 favorite qualities about yourself? What is a big project that has intimidated you for a while and what is the one simplest step you can think of that will help you advance in that project? What 3 words would you use to describe your dream life? Explain. Write them down somewhere, maybe even set them as your phone wallpaper! Make a life bucket list. Don’t hold back. You can edit later if you want but let your imagination run wild for a few minutes. Where would you travel to if you had unlimited money and time? Describe the trip in detail. Choose a mantra that you want to keep with you for a while. This is great at the beginning of a new year or month but works whenever you decide to do it. For example, my mantra for 2018 is “err on the side of action*. What do other people admire you for? Do you accept those compliments or push them away? 5 things I am looking forward to this week… The age-old “get to know you” question that tends to make people nervous: What are your hobbies? Don’t worry, you are just writing this for yourself. What do you do in your free time that you truly enjoy? Write a letter to yourself in 5 years. Tell them about your life currently and express the dreams you hope to reach in 5 years. Describe your ideal day, from waking up to going to sleep. How do you undervalue yourself? In what situations do you ask for too little when deep down you know you are worth more than that? Do you prefer spending time alone or with other people? In what situations do you feel you gain energy? Does it depend? Next steps Of course I had to make a cute printable out of this, hehe.

Spend some time with your notebook engaging with a journal prompt, and you’ll find yourself breaking out of tired patterns, inspired by new points of view. And the best part? Using a prompt produces way better journaling than just sitting in front of a blank page, trying to figure out what to write. Do you love questions that bring your ideas to life, expand your emotional intelligence, uncover hidden dreams, and reignite your passion? Then you’re going to love this post. We’ll provide a huge list of journaling prompts for use in different contexts. Specifically, we’ll cover: How journal prompts can take you off autopilot to get what you REALLY want 6 Fear-dispelling journal prompts proven to ease anxiety Over 50 prompts to help you build optimism through gratitude 12 journal prompts to give clarity when making a tough decision 30 questions to ask kids for great journal stories And a huge list of other journal prompts—sorted by category—that you can use now, or bookmark and reference, again and again ** Free Bonus: Click here to download all 301+ journal prompts in one handy PDF. ** What are journal prompts? Journal prompts are questions or first lines that serve as a guide for what to write on a blank page. Of course, you can always pick up a pen and start writing on your own, but a journaling prompt can help you think in new ways. By giving you a path to follow as you write, journal prompts encourage you to examine parts of your experience that you may not have looked at before. They help to clarify how you think and feel about things, allowing you to find a fresh perspective. Clear as dishwater? Let’s look at an example. Consider this journal prompt, and some potential scenarios it might speak to: Who helped you this week that you would like to thank and why? Maybe someone said something encouraging to you when you felt like your week was a colossal shitshow Or someone gave you a hand to finish a complex task that was weighing you down Or maybe someone just made your week better by their very presence with you Taking time to write out the who and the what will change your emotional space. You’ll begin to feel grateful—which, in positive psychology research, is consistently proven to produce greater happiness. Inspiring, right? Here’s why: We spend a lot of our life on autopilot. It’s actually a helpful feature of the human mind. Your brain focuses on actions that are new, but automates the “known,” to be more efficient with its resources. This is the reason we can wash dishes and plan a presentation at the same time. It’s the reason why we decide where we are going to sit the first time we walk into a class, and continue to choose that same seat for the rest of the semester. It’s the reason we can get in a car and drive—without going through the driver’s ed checklist of fastening the seat belt, adjusting the mirror, and putting our hands “at 10 and 2,” the way we did when we first learned to drive. But while autopilot is a helpful feature in terms of resource conservation, it can keep us in a reactive mode, rather than a proactive mode. Our automated actions are based on decisions and circumstances of the past—which aren’t necessarily aligned with what we want in our future. But we won’t know unless we take the time to think it through. Enter the magic of journaling with a prompt: a prompt can push us to examine things we don’t usually consider. Which takes us off autopilot. The benefit? We bring more intention to our decisions. We stop reacting, and start choosing. So… Are you looking for a way to live more intentionally? Do you want to stop feeling like you are living your life on a hamster wheel, and take back some control? Then ask yourself better questions—and record your answers to them—so you can find clarity on what you want, what you think, and how you feel. Using a journal prompt could be the key to doing just that. Categories for our 301+ journal prompts We’ve organized our journaling prompts into 11 different categories. Each section begins with a bit of explanation about how each type of prompt works. This is a really long list, so feel free to use these handy jump links to take you where you want to go.

Suppose you’ve had a really crappy day. Truly, truly terrible. It can start to feel like nothing is good in your life. The weight of your day will color every thought you have for the rest of the evening. But let’s say that, as a discipline, you sit down at your desk, pull out your notebook, and answer some journaling prompts on gratitude. Soon, you will have pages of evidence of the good in your life that will counter the terrible stuff, and begin to bring balance—and maybe, just maybe, tip the scales in favor of a bit of optimism. Here is a list of journaling prompts for gratitude: Write about a person who always makes you laugh. What was the best gift you received as a child? Write about an event in your life that changed it for the better. Who has loved you unconditionally? What guilty pleasure are you secretly grateful for? Write about a person you are grateful for, but sometimes take for granted. What about today made you smile? What did you eat this week that was delicious? What is something great about your community? Write about something that always makes you smile, no matter what. What about your living space are you especially thankful for? Write down one good thing that happened to you today. What in your childhood are you grateful for? Who served as a mentor to you (whether they knew it or not)? Write about three skills or talents you have that serve you well. What do you really appreciate about your life? What has surprised you, in a good way?

List 5 things that spark your curiosity and inspire your interest. What friend are you most grateful for? What makes them special? What makes you laugh so hard you get tears in your eyes?

Write about a random act of kindness. Who taught you about unconditional love? What about your upbringing are you most grateful for? Who made you feel good this week? Prompts for self-discovery Want to find a new internal spark? There is something about asking yourself about what you want and how you feel that can renew your motivation in the most surprising of ways. It’s ideal to schedule self-discovery prompts around milestones, like birthdays or the beginning of a year. It’s also powerful to create a plan to engage with them on a recurring schedule (monthly or quarterly works well). Here’s a list of journal prompts for self-discovery, so when you pull out your journal to write, you’ll have inspiring things to explore about yourself. Describe yourself in 10 words or less.

Is there a smaller version of your dream that you could accomplish in two weeks? What have you learned that has changed your values?

What would you want your favorite future relative (who doesn’t exist yet) to say about your life? Where do you show leadership? What are your plans for going after what your heart wants? What do you wish you were doing more of? Who do you want to spend more time with? Why? Who do you want to be in three years? How do you want people to see you? What’s the most important thing to focus on this week? Where are you giving something that you don’t actually want to give? When people complain about you, what do they say?

What is the one thing you need to focus on now, that will make everything else better in the future? What one discipline sparks your personal growth the most? What three keystone habits do you need to perform daily? If you had $150,000 to spend in 24 hours or less, how would you spend it? What do you happily spend a lot of money on (without feeling guilty about it), but suspect others might judge you for? What do you need to stop doing? If you only had two years to live, what would you most want to accomplish? Create a schedule for your dream life. What are you most excited about right now?

Are you an Eeyore or a Tigger? What kinds of activities take up most of your time? Are you happy about that? If not, what could you give up to gain back 30 minutes? What’s important to you right now? List 10 of your favorite things. What task are you putting off that you just need to get done? How could you finish it within the next week? Has there ever been a time you were on a path and something happened to completely shift your trajectory? What are you thinking of doing that you are afraid to tell anyone about? What are you holding onto too tightly? How could you play more? What question are you grappling with? What makes you feel overwhelmed or paralyzed? Who could you ask for help?

What do you value most? What are you not saying that needs to be said? What decision(s) are you procrastinating on making? What’s your biggest priority this month? What gets you excited about the future? What are your core values? What is your take on love? Why do you live where you do? What is your favorite thing about your current living space? What drives you crazy? Write down the steps you need to take to get from who you are to who you want to be. How are you contributing to the situation in your life that frustrates you the most? What is your personal definition of success, stripped of others’ expectations? What would you write, if you felt it wouldn’t be judged?

What skill do you need to learn to advance to the next level? What place do you want to visit, but haven’t been to yet? What’s the hardest thing you’ve ever done? Journal prompts for anxiety Like it or not, fear is a core human emotion. And the media knows it! Every day we are bombarded with a steady stream of reasons to be afraid. Our brains are wired to pay attention when something feels frightening. Even when we are perfectly safe, the threat of “what might happen” makes it hard to shut that anxious response off. (The “fight or flight or freeze” response is hard-wired into us.) Journaling about your anxiety can give your mind a place to pour out that mental chatter so that it feels heard . Once you acknowledge that an anxious thought or feeling exists, your mind feels safe enough to stop screaming at you to pay attention. Sitting with a notebook and honoring what you are worried about by writing it down can be oddly calming. These 6 powerful journaling prompts can help calm your mind by addressing different types of anxiety. Find the one that resonates most with your experience, and try it now: What do you feel anxious about? Write your stream-of-consciousness, and let it feel as if all the random fears (or that one big fear) are draining out of you onto the paper. How are you experiencing anxiety in your body? What does it feel like? Write words or use doodles to get this onto the page. What kind of self-care might calm you, allowing those feelings to pass? For example: breathing deeply, going for a run, sitting on the couch to snuggle a pet. Write down the worst thing that could happen if what you fear comes to pass— and make it as extreme as possible. For example: “…and then I’ll be laid off, and then I won’t be able to  find a job, and then I’ll be homeless and have to dig in the trash for food… ” Then, write what would probably really happen. For example: “…and then I would reach out to people I know for ideas on what my opportunities are, and, if needed, I would move back in with my family for a short time while I look for a new job.” Write the serenity prayer at the top of the page: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference.” Below it, draw a line down the center of the page. On one side, write the heading: “cannot change.” On the other side, write: “can change.” Take everything that is prompting anxiety for you in this moment, and put it into one of those categories. (Note: Most of the time the only thing you can change is yourself. Most of the “cannot change” list will be about others.) If your anxiety centers around your own performance, name your inner critic. Give it a voice and a personality. (Mine is Edith Prickley, based on the SCTV character.) Write out all the things your inner critic is saying to you. For example: “ Edith says I’m going to fail at my presentation tomorrow. She says it is going to be boring and lame and no one will be interested in what I have to say.” Writing your inner dialog out from a third-party perspective creates separation. It changes your vantage point, so you can see your thoughts more objectively. Now write back to your inner critic. For example: “ Oh Edith, I know you are afraid for me. Come here. Let me give you a hug. We are going to be okay.” Giving your inner critic a persona allows you to question it. You don’t have to accept what it says as truth. If your anxiety is sparked by overwhelm, create “popcorn pages.” Your brain knows when it has committed to a task that remains unfinished. In fact, it will ping you endlessly with reminders. After all, part of the brain’s job is to keep track of things until they get done. But when there are too many open loops, you can start to feel overwhelmed. Pull out a piece of paper and write down every open loop your brain keeps pinging you with. Scatter them popcorn-style across your page. If you are like most people, you will probably end up with a weird mix of the essential and the trivial—from all different areas of your life. Write fast, then pause to see what comes into your brain next. (Your brain is going to be so happy that you’re doing this, it will flood your thoughts with all the things.) Now, use a highlighter to color-code similar things—items that can be addressed together. Block out time on your calendar to schedule when you are going to deal with each collection of color-coded items. Once a task’s completion is scheduled, your brain can start to relax. (You’ll find even more relief if you take care of at least one piece of “popcorn” on the page immediately.) Journal prompts for depression Depression is a serious mental state—characterized by feelings of sadness, withdrawal from connection, and a lack of interest in daily life. If you are currently struggling with suicidal thoughts, please call the National Hopeline Network: 1-800-784-2433. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also has a hotline to help you find resources to treat and manage depression: call 1-800-662-HELP. Journaling is not a cure for depression, but it does have benefits for people who are depressed. Depression creates a fog around who we are, what we think, and how we feel. Journaling can empower you to regain clarity. Here are some journal prompts that may help: Write morning pages. Artist Julia Cameron popularized this practice of unloading the mind first thing every morning. In her book, The Artist’s Way , Cameron writes: “In order to retrieve your creativity, you need to find it. I ask you to do this by an apparently pointless process I call the morning pages…the morning pages are three pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness.” Morning pages are not intended to be either writing or art. Rather, they are a kinesthetic exercise that helps your brain clear itself, so you can be more focused and creative for the rest of your day. (For more on this, watch Julia Cameron’s video about Morning Pages .) If some of your depression is being caused by anger you’ve felt helpless to act on, write an angry letter. (You don’t have to send it.) Write about a need you know someone has, and describe how you could help alleviate their suffering. What are you tolerating that you shouldn’t be? Write about something you know to be true. Write a letter of forgiveness to someone who hurt you. Write a letter of forgiveness to yourself. When did you start to lose interest in things? How far back can you trace these feelings? How are your current circumstances affecting your mental health? Can you see beyond where you are now to a better future? What is the thing you are afraid to say out loud? What would you write, if you didn’t feel like you would be judged for it? Write what you wish someone would say to you. Journal prompts for therapy Great therapists ask great questions. They draw out what  you are really thinking and how you are feeling with their queries. And while there is no substitute for someone trained in this art, this process of querying and answering yourself can be a very therapeutic process. Here are some prompts for using your journal as a complement to therapy: Who in my life can I be my full self with, unapologetically? What am I doing when I feel most free? Who am I, outside of the roles I play? What do I need to forgive myself for? Am I a victim or a hero in my own story? What do I need to do to change for the better? What am I feeling right now? How long have I had this feeling? Who triggers negative emotions in me? Why? Who triggers positive emotions in me? Why? When I get caught in a thinking loop, what am I thinking about? When have I cried happy tears? What made that happen? Who have I lied to? Why? What would have happened if I’d told the truth? What is my biggest regret? How can I make amends? What is something I am angry about, but haven’t dealt with? How do I feel about the statement: “I am enough”? What do I not get credit for? Would I parent your children in the same way I was parented? Why or why not? My past doesn’t define who I am because… I have trouble sleeping when… How would I tell the story of my life in three sentences? “Dear [name of a person I’ve lost], …” One area I need to improve on is… Right now, my thoughts are _____________. I wish they were _______________. I really wish others knew this about me: … What barrier(s) do I need to overcome? Journal prompts for self-love No matter how amazing we are, our self-talk can be downright mean. Phrases we would NEVER say to a friend spin around in our own minds like ninja throwing stars. What’s worse: we can become so immersed in these thought patterns that we never notice how they’re doing damage to our beautiful souls, over and over again. Journaling for self-love is a fierce shield of defense against this roaring inner voice. It retrains our minds and heals our hearts. Here are some journaling prompts that can foster self-love: What does my inner child most need me to say to him/her? Where have I shown kindness to others? How can I be kinder to myself? What am I wearing when I feel really beautiful? What about my personality do people compliment me on? How do I want to grow? What do I want to experience?  What do I want to contribute? What barrier keeps me from loving myself? What do I need to feel at peace? How would I talk to myself if I were 3 years old? Some of the most wonderful words ever said to me were… What fulfills me? What change do I most want to see in my world? What kind of self-care would be most useful right now? When I feel loved, how do I show up? How does my inner voice sound when it is beautiful? Journal prompts for clarity of action Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we just don’t know what to do. We have to make a decision—a hard choice—and it feels overwhelming. When you are in that tough space, your journal can be an incredible ally. There are questions we can ask ourselves before we take action that can clarify what we really want and make the path for our choices clear. Here are some journaling prompts to try when you need clarity of action: Will this matter in two days? Two months? Two years? Does this need to be said? Does this need to be said by you? Does this need to be said by you now? Which path most closely aligns with your highest values? Will this allow you to use your strengths or will you primarily be performing in areas you don’t enjoy? How much do you want this? What am you willing to give up to get it? What would you do if money wasn’t a factor? If you had no say and someone else made this choice for you, which choice would make you feel disappointed? Why? What would you wish for someone you love, if they were in this situation? What outcome are you working toward? What if you did nothing? Mindfulness journal prompts The heart of mindfulness is about directing your attention—typically in the present moment. While journaling can be a great mindfulness practice, there are specific prompts that can help bring awareness to your current experience. Here are some journaling prompts for mindfulness: How do you feel in your body right now? What is your predominant emotion? How are you experiencing it physically? When were you fully in the moment today? What are you enjoying right now? Draw a mandala or zentangle . If you let your thoughts wander, what memory comes to mind first? Where did you notice beauty today? What insights came to you in meditation today? What mundane daily ritual could you bring your full attention to, staying completely in the moment? Write a stream-of-consciousness with no clear goal. Just write, letting your thoughts go by as you release them to the paper. Writing your personal history Journaling your personal history allows you to capture personal and family stories in a way that makes your journal become a legacy. Your family can read the stories to learn about themselves and where they come from. Personal history journals can be digital, but they can also be handwritten, with pictures pasted in to give them an heirloom feel. Whether you decide to go with pen and paper or create a digital journal, these journal prompts can give shape and inspiration to yourpersonal history journal: Write about your name. What does it mean? Who chose it? What’s the ethnicity of your surname? Do you know what it means or where it comes from? Where were you born? Where were your parents born? How did your mother and father meet? Write about the first home you remember. Where was your favorite place to spend time? What did you spend hours doing as a child? What was your favorite toy? What kinds of wildlife did you encounter as a kid? When you were younger, what did you like to do when it rained? Did you have a favorite book as a child? (Or a favorite book you read to your children?) What did your grandparents tell you about how they grew up? What is a family story that gets told over and over when people are together? Describe the kitchen in the home you spent the most time in. What did a typical mealtime look like when you were growing up? What was your favorite food? Write some of your favorite things about your mother, father, siblings, cousins, and/or grandparents. Help the reader get to know them. Where did you go to school? What subjects did you enjoy? Who was your childhood best friend? Tell us about them. Where did your parents work? What was their trade? Do you know how your grandparents made their living? What did your family do really well? How did they show love? What movie did your family watch over and over? Remember when you were a kid and someone told you not to do something? What did you do that you were not supposed to? When did your curiosity get the better of you? Did your family survive a tragedy? What happened? What was high school like for you? Did you go to events like football games, prom, or spend weekends gaming in a friend’s basement? What world events impacted you when you were younger? How did they affect you? What was the hardest part about growing up? What pets do you have? Are there any family stories your aunts or uncles told you that you want to be sure to write down? Write about your first week of college, or the first week at your first job. Write about the first place you lived on your own. Write about when and how you learned to manage money and pay bills. What did things cost then? Capture what different decades were like for you. Write about your 20’s, your 30’s, etc. If you’re married, how did you meet your spouse? Are there any stories you want to record from when you were dating? Did you have a marriage that didn’t work out? What do you want to say about that? Describe a mundane day. What is life like for you? Write down what you wish you knew about your grandparents’ or great-grandparents’ daily lives. What captures your imagination? What do you enjoy doing most with friends and family? What are holidays like for you? What traditions do you hope carry on? If you have kids, write about them. What do you want them to know about their younger selves? What advice would you give future generations who read this journal? What were you worried about as a kid that turned out to be not a big deal for you as a grown up? Bullet Journal collection ideas People who use the Bullet Journal Method will be familiar with the term “collections.” A collection is a topical page in your journal that covers a specific category. This is usually a log, tracker, or list of some kind. Since a Bullet Journal is supposed to be simple, you don’t want to track everything—only the things that matter to you—but sometimes looking through a list of things that others are logging can help you decide what collection pages to include in your own journal. Here are some journal prompts for Bullet Journal collections: Books you read this year Roller coasters you’ve ridden (or ballparks you’ve visited, or states you’ve been to) Your bucket list (make it official; write it down!) Packing or camping list Wish list Home repairs to make Daily affirmations A category of things you own for which having a list is helpful (textbooks, collectables, essential oils, etc.) Meal ideas or a master grocery list Event planner List of family/friends’ birthdays Savings tracker (this is particularly helpful if you are saving to buy a particular item) Family gift list (what you gave, or good gift ideas) Movies you want to stream Healthy snacks list Pen or watercolor swatches Homework assignments or work deadlines Job search Recurring annual charges Apps you love or apps to try Research for articles, papers, or just topics you are interested in Business plan lists Project ideas 90 day goals Social media stats Accounts and passwords Things to do in your own city Date night ideas Funny quotes from your friends or kids (or your friend’s kids) Basic medical information (list of meds, services, doctors’ numbers, insurance, etc.) The last time I called… (make sure you are keeping up with the people you love) Sleep log Activity tracker (this can be anything: exercise, painting, water consumption, or even journaling) Prompts just for kids Thirty-something Chase was home for the weekend and going through a box of memorabilia when he came across a journal given to him by his third-grade teacher. Each Monday, she’d given the class a journal prompt, and asked them to write their thoughts. As Chase sat in the living room reading each entry (written in decidedly third-grade handwriting) out loud, his whole family was filled with both laughter and nostalgia as they listened to his elementary school perspective on his life. You can create this same kind of record for a kid you love as well—and you don’t have to wait until they are thirty to find the answers endearing and hilarious. Either give them a prompt and have them write the answer, or ask the question and record the answers yourself Here are 30 prompts to discover a child’s perspective: How does money work? What have your friends been up to? What’s the silliest thing you could write on this page? What makes you feel brave? What makes you feel curious? What do you like best for breakfast? What do you love about your favorite movie (or book)? If you started a business, what would it be? If you had all the money in the world, what would you buy? If you were going to invent a recipe, what would you invent? If you could be invisible, where would you go? If you could make up a new color, what would you call it? What question do you want to ask your pet? (And what do you think they would say?) What will your room look like when you grow up? What do you think is super gross? What did you do this weekend? What is your favorite thing about yourself? If you could be an animal, what kind of animal would you like to be? What is your superhero name? What powers do you have? What was the best gift you ever received? Write (or tell me) about a dream you had. What do you remember from when you were really little? What kinds of games do you like to play? What is your favorite joke? If there was something you never ever had to do again, what would that be? Why? If you had to eat the same food every day for the rest of your life, what would you pick? Why? What are you really, really good at? What do you love about it? What is your favorite thing to talk about with your friends? What are you looking forward to? What does mommy (or daddy) do at work? How to use a journal jar We’ve explored a lot of different types of journal prompts, but what if you’re not sure what topic you want to write about? Or maybe you saw a question in one of these lists that scared you a little, or made you uneasy. You know it would do you some good to sit with that question, but you’re not quite sure you have the courage, and need a way to trick yourself into it. A journal jar is the perfect solution in both of these scenarios. (It’s also a great way to cultivate a spirit of adventure!) No, it’s not a jar that you write on (although you could). A journal jar is simply a container filled with little scraps of paper that have journal prompts written (or printed) on them. It can be as simple as a plain mason jar full of handwritten ideas, or—if you know that buying or making a pretty jar and using beautifully pre-printed or hand-crafted slips of paper for your prompts will propel you to use it—you can make it as fancy as you like. (Check out some of the journal jars on Etsy for inspiration.) ** Free Bonus: Click here to download all 301+ journal prompts in one handy PDF . ** P.S. The prompts in the PDF are intentionally spaced to make them easy to cut out and put them in your journal jar. Simply place your journal prompts in the jar, and make it a practice to pull one out every day. The only rule is that you have to use the prompt—whatever’s on that piece of paper is what you’ll write about that day. If you’re going for a scrapbook feel, you can paste the prompt into your journal and add some simple illustrations to pretty up each entry. You can also save the prompts to use again when your jar is empty, or discard them in favor of choosing new ones later. We’ve given you 301+ journal prompts to get you started, but there are so many more out there. Go ahead and tell me. What did I miss? Yes, this is an enormous list—but everyone journals for different reasons. It’s important to find and use prompts that are aligned with the kind of journaling you most want to do. Do you have a prompt not already listed here that you love? Please share it in the comments. I’d love to hear what inspires you to write in your journal!

More. When I was a teenager, my journal was a dark place. I used it as a place to hold my deepest thoughts, and they usually weren’t too pretty. A typical journal entry highlighted the worst parts of my day, my biggest insecurities, and a sense of hopelessness. I can’t help but wonder, if I had used some structure for my journal, how would it have changed my life? What I mean by that is, if I’d used my journal as a tool to guide my thoughts in a more positive light, would I have struggled less with my mental wellness and negative self-talk? I’ll never really know, but I can tell you that the way I journal now is much different. Over the past couple months, journaling has become a huge part of my daily routine. I’ve found that when I take time to journal in the morning, it helps me to have a positive mindset during the rest of my day. ✨ Need a journal? I created a beautiful guided journal to help you more out of journaling. Check it out here! I typically write out some affirmations, create a gratitude list, or follow some journal prompts. I’ve found journal prompts to be especially helpful, especially since I don’t always know what to write about—even if I want to. So that’s why I wrote this post! I wanted to share some of my favorite self love, self discovery, and personal growth journal prompts. Some of these prompts are ones I see all the time, and some of them are ones I created—especially the self love ones. I have a lot of trouble with most self love journal prompts because typically I’m using them when I don’t feel like I love myself, and I think it’s important that the journal prompt guides you toward self love, and not potentially toward self-loathing. So with that being said, I hope these journal prompts help you! I’d love it if you pinned this post on Pinterest, and feel free to comment and let me know which prompts are your best! There are 20 journal prompts for each category: Self love Self discovery Self improvement And of course, you can grab a free self discovery journal prompts worksheet below! ↓ Self Love Journal Prompts Your best personality trait is . . .

More. When I was a teenager, my journal was a dark place. I used it as a place to hold my deepest thoughts, and they usually weren’t too pretty. A typical journal entry highlighted the worst parts of my day, my biggest insecurities, and a sense of hopelessness. I can’t help but wonder, if I had used some structure for my journal, how would it have changed my life? What I mean by that is, if I’d used my journal as a tool to guide my thoughts in a more positive light, would I have struggled less with my mental wellness and negative self-talk? I’ll never really know, but I can tell you that the way I journal now is much different. Over the past couple months, journaling has become a huge part of my daily routine. I’ve found that when I take time to journal in the morning, it helps me to have a positive mindset during the rest of my day. ✨ Need a journal? I created a beautiful guided journal to help you more out of journaling. Check it out here! I typically write out some affirmations, create a gratitude list, or follow some journal prompts. I’ve found journal prompts to be especially helpful, especially since I don’t always know what to write about—even if I want to. So that’s why I wrote this post! I wanted to share some of my favorite self love, self discovery, and personal growth journal prompts. Some of these prompts are ones I see all the time, and some of them are ones I created—especially the self love ones. I have a lot of trouble with most self love journal prompts because typically I’m using them when I don’t feel like I love myself, and I think it’s important that the journal prompt guides you toward self love, and not potentially toward self-loathing. So with that being said, I hope these journal prompts help you! I’d love it if you pinned this post on Pinterest, and feel free to comment and let me know which prompts are your best! There are 20 journal prompts for each category: Self love Self discovery Self improvement And of course, you can grab a free self discovery journal prompts worksheet below! ↓ Self Love Journal Prompts Your best personality trait is . . .

That’s exactly how I felt at the beginning of this year. Things were going well in many areas of my life, but I was unhappy living in my boyfriend’s childhood home in a Bay Area suburb, after we’d spent years living in LA and traveling. Though I knew this was ideal for him, it just didn’t feel right for me, And even if I could wrap my brain around asking him to leave his hometown when he was just settling back in and reconnecting with old friends, I wasn’t entirely sure what would make sense for us both long term, given that we have family on opposite coasts. Some days I’d start crying out of nowhere, while eating breakfast, working, or watching TV. I’d feel fear, anxiety, and confusion, and then more guilt for being so emotional and unable to identify and own my desires. One day I realized I’d fallen into a trap I’d fallen into many times before, and an ironic one, at that: because I’d felt trapped in my circumstances, I’d gotten trapped in my emotions. I was dwelling, overanalyzing, and worrying about worst-case scenarios. No wonder I was so blocked. I was trying to solve a problem from a place of desperation and fear. Always a recipe for disaster. So I decided to do something I’d done before, but hadn’t in quite a while: I started a gratitude journal . I knew I needed to nurture more positive emotions on a daily basis, and that everything would get clearer and easier from there. At first it was a little difficult. I’d write something down—“catching up with my brother,” for example—but it didn’t necessarily change how I felt. That’s when I remembered that knowing you should be grateful and truly feeling gratitude are two very different things. In order to actually feel gratitude, I had to dig deeper and reflect upon just how fortunate I was. People have always seen me as fortunate, even when I was secretly struggling with depression and bulimia, as I’ve always appeared to have a lot going for me. But I realize I am more fortunate than ever at this point in my life. I just needed a little more to help me access my gratitude, buried as it was beneath layers of fear and anxiety. Throughout this year, I’ve been building a list of questions that help me identify what I most appreciate about my life and the people in it. If you too could benefit from nurturing more positive emotions—and let’s face it, we all could—try asking yourself one of these questions and see where they take you. 1. What’s one kind or thoughtful thing someone did for you recently? 2. Who is always there for you, and how do you feel about them? 3. Who has helped you become the person you are today, and what’s the top thing you’d thank them for? 4. Who’s someone who always really listens when you talk, and how does that affect you? 5. How have your spiritual beliefs or practices fulfilled you recently? 6. What’s the best thing that happened today so far? 7. What’s something that inspired or touched you recently? 8. Has anyone done anything recently that made your job easier? 9. What’s one thing you enjoyed about doing your job recently? 10. Can you think of any non-physical gifts you’ve received recently—someone’s time, attention, understanding, or support? 11. What about today has been better than yesterday? 12. Who have you enjoyed being around recently, and why? 13. How have you used your talents and abilities recently, and what have you enjoyed about doing that? 14. What have you learned recently that will help you in the future? 15. What made you laugh or smile today? 16. What’s the last song you heard that you enjoyed? How did it make you feel, and why? 17. Have you experienced any blessings in disguise lately—things that didn’t turn out as you’d hoped and yet turned out for the best? 18. What’s the weather like today, and what’s one good thing about that? 19. How has technology enhanced your life and your connections recently? 20. Have you had an opportunity to help someone recently, and how did you feel about that? 21. What’s one thing you experienced recently that made you feel a sense of wonder or awe? 22. What’s the best thing about your home, and have you taken time to enjoy it recently? 23. If you didn’t get what you wanted today, can you identify something in what you got that’s worth having? 24. What’s improved about your life from this time last year? 25. What choices have you made in the last five years that you’d thank yourself for making? 26. What’s something you did well recently, and what qualities or skills enabled you to do this? 27. Who made a positive difference in your life recently? 28. What’s something you’re looking forward to in the future? 29. What did you learn from the most difficult part of your day yesterday, and how will this lesson benefit you going forward? 30. What’s something you witnessed recently that reminded you that life is good? 31. What’s something you witnessed recently that reminded you that people are good? 32. How many of your basic needs do you not need to worry about meeting today? 33. What event or interaction made you feel good about yourself recently? 34. How have you made personal or professional progress lately? 35. What simple pleasures did you enjoy—or can you enjoy—today? 36. What modern conveniences (i.e.: electronics and appliances) do you enjoy that make your life easier? 37. What’s the most beautiful thing you saw today? 38. What’s something enjoyable you get to experience every day that you’ve come to take for granted? 39. What are three things your arms or legs allow you to do that you enjoy? 40. What’s the kindest thing someone has done for you lately? 41. How do your friends and/or family members show they care about you? 42. What’s the last thing you enjoyed with your senses—a good meal, a song you love, or aromatherapy—and how amazing is it that you were able to experience that? 43. What movie, book, blog, or article affected your life for the better recently? 44. What have you seen in nature recently that made you feel happy, peaceful, or free? 45. How has modern medicine improved your life, recently or overall? 46. How does electricity simplify and improve your life—and can you imagine what life would like be like without it? 47. What’s your favorite thing about your bed, and how often does it enable you to get restful sleep? 48. What’s something you have easy access to that always improves your mood, and how has it improved your life? 49. Who in your life has survived something difficult, and how do you feel when you think about the fact that they’re still here? 50. Have you recently imagined a worst-case scenario that didn’t actually happen? This last one was crucial for me. Not only did this help me appreciate things that turned out better than I’d anticipated, it reminded me how often this happens—if only I’m willing to act. And act I did. A couple of months ago my fiancé and I moved back to LA, still far from my family, but in an area I love, near an industry we both love. And we’re now planning to start working on short films together. We’re also prioritizing visits with our loved ones, together and separately, so we can both still nurture our relationships. It’s a compromise we can both not only live with, but hopefully one that will enable us to thrive. I am far happier for having made this choice (and grateful that my fiancé was open to it). And I know I found clarity and the strength to act on this, in large part, because I made the effort to change my mental state. It’s funny how that happens. We can sit around and stress about our problems all we want, trying to force a solution. But sometimes the best way to fix what isn’t working is to first focus on what is. Everything gets easier when we move past fear and desperation and nurture a grateful, hopeful heart. UPDATE: Tiny Buddha’s Gratitude Journal is now available for purchase!

            "12 Questions To Bring More Gratitude Into Your Life 12 Questions To Bring More Gratitude Into Your Life 12 Questions To Bring More Gratitude Into Your Life By Danielle Dowling, Psy.D. Doctor of Psychology Danielle Dowling, Psy.D. is a doctor of psychology and life coach, helping ambitious, driven women achieve the financial, spiritual, and lifestyle abundance they desire and deserve. She holds a bachelor's in business from American University, and her master's and doctor of psychology degree from Ryokan College. Doctor of Psychology October 29, 2013 Making big things happen and crafting more daily joy is all about (slowly, lovingly) nudging yourself out of your comfort zone and straight into your full potential. You’ve been busy living a life doing what lights you up, creating firm boundaries, acknowledging your fears and zapping them with love. What gorgeous progress, yes? Yet, we (me included!) can get overwhelmed and down on ourselves about what we haven’t done. The best way I know to transition into feeling good and making progress? Yup, you guessed it: celebrate what you have done! Practice grateful acknowledgement of the small and momentous leaps you've made. When you're feeling grateful, your mind is clear, you have a delicious relationship to the universe, and you become more aware of the big picture. Every moment offers an opportunity for thanks. And every \"thank-you\" can return you to the present, reminding you of what a friendly place the world can be. It might take us a few seconds or a few minutes to put our attention on what we are grateful for, but it's worth it. Gratitude makes us feel good. The benefits of gratitude are HUGE. For yourself, it can be a  symbolic way of giving back. For others, your gratitude is a mirror: a recognition, appreciation, encouragement and inspiration. Gratitude gives you true clarity and focus on how your successes came to be. Practicing this gives you the confidence to do the other scary tasks at hand and continuously catapult your life forward. What goodness have you created in the last day, week, months or year? Forgetting to celebrate your successes (yup, I do this, too!) can lead to a total energy drain. Graciously, humbly celebrating success can booster the commitment to repeatedly go after your heart’s desire. It helps you steer clear of that sabotaging little voice that says, “I can’t, I’m not enough ... I’m too much ... I’ll never do anything right. I’ll never ... ” Spirit Gladiator, yes you can, you are, you do, and you will! Making the time to give thanks for your successes (and yes, failures) roots us firmly in the knowledge that we are beyond loved and loving, powerful and making progress around what we most desire. It is also a reminder that it is not only about us. Deep, bountiful success is about giving. Give and give all. Create a big, gorgeous space to complete this statement: I AM GRATEFUL FOR: _______________________________ Here are 12 questions to help you invite some gratitude into your life: What have others done that has benefitted by life—even if I don't know who those people are?

            "50 Therapeutic Journal Prompts for Mental Health - Nerd Knows Life Home About Me Services About Blog Contact Freebies Products 50 Therapeutic Journal Prompts for Mental Health Updated on June 5, 2018 By KrissyCross 4 Comments If you’ve ever struggled with stress or any form of a mental health issue, you may have found how helpful it can be to keep a journal. Getting things off of your chest/mind and onto paper can help us not only face what we are dealing with but also provide a means of self-expression. Here are some therapeutic journal prompts for mental health: Write down 5 things that make you incredibly happy and describe why they make you feel this way. What do you fear the most? Why? Is your fear rational? What qualities about yourself do you love the most? In the next year, what are 5 improvements you would like to make regarding your life? Write about the improvements and create a plan to accomplish each one. Write about your one of your happiest memories? Write about the people in your life that make you feel the most “at ease” and what they do to make you feel that way. Write about a difficult memory and the coping mechanisms you used at the time. Would you change the way you dealt? How? Write a poem (that DOESN’T HAVE TO RHYME), describing the exact opposite of yourself. Write about the last time you cried. What caused you to cry? Write about the last time you laughed really hard. What was so funny? Write a letter to the future YOU. Write a letter to one of your parents – even if you don’t actually give it to them. What has your anxiety taught you about yourself? Write down a list of ‘regrets’. Either throw them away or toss them into a fire. (Let go of past regrets & move on). In detail, describe a perfect day. Write a letter to a person who has negatively impacted you. (Again, you don’t actually have to send it out). Write a letter to a person who has positively impacted you. Write about an incredibly difficult choice you’ve had to make in your life. Write down all your coping mechanisms. Evaluate the ones that are most helpful and the ones that are the most detrimental. Describe what love means to you in detail. Write a letter of forgiveness to yourself. Write down 3 of your favorite smells. Describe, in detail, how each one makes you feel. Have you ever felt isolated? Write about it. Write about 5 songs that mean the most to you. Why do the lyrics speak to you? How do you relate to these songs? How do they make you feel when you hear them? Write down all the compliments you can think of, that you’ve received. Write down compliments to people in your life. Write a list of 10 things you want to remember during difficult times. (Use this later if you’re feeling down). What risks do you want to take? What’s holding you back? What element do you consider to be YOU? Write about why. (Earth, Air, Fire, Water). What are some of the strongest emotions you’ve ever felt? Write about how those emotions affected you and what caused you to feel those emotions. Physically, how do you feel right now? What speaks to you on an spiritual level? (Poetry, quote, song ect.) Write about it. What items/objects do you find the most comforting? Why do you think that is? What is comforting about them? Write a love letter to yourself. Write about something that is frustrating to you. If you could be anywhere in the world at this very moment, where would you want to be and why? What are 3 things that make you angry? Why? What activities do you think would make you feel better? Make a plan to carry out those activities. Write about something random you’ve seen that made you smile. Describe your dream house. Who or what (or both), helps motivate you the most? Why is that? What are you worried about? Why? What are some of your favorite books? Why? Write about them. What makes you laugh? Write about what you perceive to be the worst thing you’ve ever done. When is the last time you did something for someone else? What did you do and how did it make you feel? What secrets are you keeping? Are these secrets affecting your life or mental health? Why or why not? Write about something that truly surprised you. Describe an outfit that makes you feel completely comfortable in your own skin. If you weren’t afraid, what are 5 things you would do? Are there any ways you can think of to overcome the fear? Write a letter of forgiveness to someone who has caused you pain. Keeping a journal can be a great way to manage your mental health. You can explore your deepest emotions and identify healthy means to deal with your feelings. I hope these prompts can help you get your feelings onto paper and release the negative emotions from your mind. 🙂 Keep track of your emotions & keep moving forward. Much Love.

Sarah wwwmentalillnesssucks.com Reply Alle January 20, 2021 I know this article is from like 3 years ago, but I’ve wanted to try some journalling and I felt like I needed some prompts so here I am. I just did my first journal with a random prompt of yours and it was truly therapeutic. I didn’t know how badly I just need to dump my thoughts onto a page. And confronting my feelings and thoughts in this way is overwhelming. I sat there typing on my computer just crying, a cry that I’ve needed to release for a while. So thank you, I wanted you to know that you helped at least one person with this article.

Whether you’re just getting started with journaling for depression , or need fresh journal prompts for mental health to keep you inspired, you’ve come to the right place. As a full-time blogger who suffers from anxiety and the occasional panic attack, I appreciate the importance of journaling as a therapeutic approach to depression. Putting pen to paper provides an uncensored outlet for people to write down their thoughts and feelings freely, allowing them to gain control over their emotions and perspective about their problems, and also formulate more appropriate ways to respond to the world. Journaling helps identify different triggers and trends over time, allowing us to see when we’re at our best – and when we’re at our worst. I was first introduced to the concept of journaling by my tenth grade English teacher (Mr. S), who was nothing short of amazing. He was equal parts cool and quirky, and instilled a deep passion for literature and writing in me, and while his class syllabus was certainly intense, Mr. S had a way of making me want to do the work. He introduced me to the classics, like The Catcher in the Rye , Tom Sawyer , and To Kill a Mockingbird , and when we weren’t debating symbolism, analogies, and metaphors, he required each of us to keep a journal. The idea was simple: we were required to write about whatever was on our minds for 10 uninterrupted minutes each day. We could write about anything  – one of the books we were reading in class, a school project we were involved with, an argument we had with one of our friends, an upcoming family vacation – and we were encouraged to forget about proper grammar and spelling, and just write from the heart. I initially thought this was a bit silly, but as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I found myself looking forward to those 10 minutes where I could get my feelings out on paper. It helped to clear my head, provided insight into my problems, and helped me put things into perspective. I kept up with my journal over the summer and on and off for the rest of high school, and while the idea fizzled as I got older and pursued a career in writing, I’ve noticed that journaling has started to pick up steam over the last couple of years. And there are so many different types of journals to choose from! You can keep a depression and anxiety journal, therapy journal, self care journal, mental health journal…the list goes on and on. Of course, buying a journal is only half the battle. In order to fully reap the benefits of journaling for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues, you must make the commitment to keep at it, and find meaningful journal prompts to keep you motivated and engaged. We’ve shared 33 journal prompts for mental health below, but before we get to those, let’s take a closer look at how journal writing can be used as a self-care tool. What are the benefits of journaling? While journaling isn’t a ‘cure’ for depression and other mental health issues, the benefits of writing your thoughts and worries out on paper cannot be ignored. Regular journaling: Provides an outlet. Journaling for depression and other mental health issues provides a way to address all of your feelings, and if you choose to keep your journal private, you don’t have to worry about censoring any of your thoughts. This can feel a little weird at first, but it can be really helpful to get everything off your chest without worrying about offending or upsetting someone else. Promotes a sense of calm. Writing our thoughts out on paper forces us to come to terms with the things we’re feeling, and while this can initially cause us to feel anxious, stressed, sad, or ashamed, working through our thoughts typically brings us back to a state of calm. Provides solutions. There are tons of journal prompts for mental health (see below!) that are designed to help us think outside our comfort zone, and as we write, we inevitably start to come up with solutions to our problems. Helps us gain perspective. Journaling offers a deeper glimpse into our minds. It helps us understand why we react to things the way we do, and the more honest we are in our writing, the more perspective we gain. Keeps us accountable. When you’re working towards a specific goal (weight loss) or something a little broader (happiness), journaling for depression and mental health has the added benefit of keeping you accountable. Tracking your habits, working through the obstacles you encounter, and formulating plans to reach your goals will have a positive impact on your success. Helps identify triggers and patterns. Keeping a written log of your moods and feelings can help you identify certain trends over time. You may notice your mood is influenced by your menstrual cycle, that interactions with certain individuals cause your anxiety to increase, and that you are better able to cope with your feelings after a good night of sleep. The trick is to write it all down and reflect back on your journal entries periodically to see what insights you can gain. How to start a journal Journaling shouldn’t feel overwhelming, and my biggest advice is to start small and keep at it. Remember that your journal is not meant to be perfect. It’s a personal collection of your thoughts and feelings, and shouldn’t be shared with others (unless you want to), so there is no right or wrong way to get started. All you need to do it write. I’m serious! Here are 7 tips to help you get started with journaling for depression and mental illness. Choose the kind of journal you want to keep. I realize this sounds really easy, but with so many types of journals to choose from (see below for some of our favorites), it really can be overwhelming. My suggestion is to choose a plain notebook to begin – you can always move to a guided journal like the ones outlined a bit later in this post once you have an idea of the direction you’d like to take through your writing. Opt for a notebook with a fun or inspirational cover if you can (I love this journal as the quote on the front makes me want to be the best in everything I do!), and don’t be afraid to invest in colored pens to decorate the pages and help boost your mood while you’re writing. Write your first entry. Staring at a blank page can be extremely intimidating. Trust me, I know! There are countless times I sit at this computer not knowing what to write about, or how to get started, and when it comes to journaling for mental health, it can be that much harder. The trick is to just DO IT. Write down the first things that come to your mind, or check out our list of journal prompts for mental health below for some ideas to get you started. Set a timer. A good way to start journaling is giving yourself a time limit of 5 or 10 minutes to get your thoughts down on paper. If you leave it open-ended it might start to seem daunting or you may start to get bored. When you have a set time, you’re more likely to focus, and you’ll get more out of the time you spend writing. Schedule it. If you have a busy calendar, or struggle to find the motivation to do the things you should be doing for your mental health, I urge you to schedule time for journaling into your daily routine. Again, you don’t need to devote HEAPS of time to this. Five to 10 minutes is all you need to get your thoughts onto paper. Figure out when you’re more likely to have the time to write – and when you benefit most from it – and then make it a habit. Date your entries. Dating your journal entries allows you to look back and reflect over what’s been happening in your life and how you’ve felt at different times, and can provide a lot of useful information to you. You may start to see patterns and trends to help you anticipate your feelings and emotions, and it’s incredibly helpful to track progress towards goals over time. Be Truthful. Your journal is yours and yours alone. Allow yourself to write down the truth about what’s going on in your life and how you’re feeling about it. Don’t talk yourself out of accepting what you’re really feeling. Take your time, go slow and let the truth flow out. The more open and honest you are, the more you will get out of your journaling journey. Re-read Your Entries. There’s something important in every journal entry you write, even if you don’t see/know it when you’re writing it. Always keep your journal entries and re-read them. They’ll offer lots of insight at a time you need it most. 7 of our favorite guided journals If free writing isn’t your thing, or you’re looking for a way to use your writing towards achieving a certain goal (living a life with gratitude, being happier, being more productive, etc.), here are 7 guided journals you may consider. The Five Minute Journal . If you’re just starting out with journaling and would rather have a guide than just jotting down all your thoughts on paper, the Five Minute Journal may be a great option for you. This journal helps you focus your attention on the good in your life, cultivating gratitude and improving your mental well-being. It provides you with a simple structure that only takes five minutes to fill out, combining the proven elements of positive psychology so you can reflect and evaluate as you start and end your day. The Bullet Journal . If you have a thing for lists, you will LOVE The Bullet Journal . It’s a way to ‘track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future’, and it has really taken off in recent years. It allows you to record important tidbits of information throughout the day and keep track of important tasks and upcoming events, and through the use of different signifiers, you can create daily, weekly, and monthly logs to keep your life organized and in synch. It’s pretty impressive. 52 Lists for Happiness . Another favorite for list lovers, 52 Lists for Happiness contains (you guessed it!) 52 writing prompts that guide you through creating a weekly list of positivity, which you can add to daily. Perfect for those who are trying to practice mindfulness and gratitude, this guided journal is a fabulous self-discovery tool. Q&A a Day: 5-Year Journal . If your main goal with journaling is simply to write, but you have trouble coming up with meaningful things to write about each day, the Q&A a Day: 5-Year Journal may be the thing for you. Each day comes with a new question – some serious, some silly – and at the end of the 5 years you can start again and see how your thoughts and feelings have changed over time. How to Be Happy (Or at Least Less Sad) . This isn’t a journal, per se, but I highly recommend it. It’s a self-help workbook of sorts, with mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy principals weaved throughout. The book will provide you with writing prompts that will help you see the positives and negatives in your life, and help put a different spin on the things that get you down. Find out more HERE . The Happy Book . As this title suggests, this guided journal is all about happiness. The idea is to focus on the good things in your life, giving you something tangible to reflect on when you feel down and need a reminder of all the things that bring you joy. Start Where You Are . This journal is all about self-reflection, and through different writing prompts, activities, and inspirational quotes, you will begin to see the good in yourself, making it the perfect guided journal for those struggling with self-confidence. 33 daily journal prompts for mental health Describe your perfect day – who would you spend it with and what would you do?

Being able to strengthen your emotional functions by journaling is a great way for business leaders and entrepreneurs to handle stress in the workplace.

So, let’s get into some self-care writing ideas… 1. What Was Your Favourite Childhood Book? List your favourite book, and explain why it’s your favourite. Remember to think back to the feelings you felt when reading this book and really try to put it into words. Was it a story of comfort for you? Did it reassure you of something?

Describe the situation and surroundings during this time. Where were you, who were you with, what were you doing? What made you feel so happy? Can you create this feeling in other ways to re-experience this sensation? If yes, write down these ideas. 3. Stream of Consciousness Writing: Wait – what is this?

More tips when using the therapy journal prompts above: Some of the therapeutic benefits of journaling is that it is a positive way to express different thoughts. You can write about your own experiences and think of little things you can do to start feeling better. It is a starting point of letting good things happen in your life. While journaling can be done anywhere, it is always nice to find a comfort zone where you feel safe to write down your thoughts. Think of your journal entry as your own private space for your mind. Write down the kind of things that are running through your mind. It can be your deepest thoughts, good things and even small things that you are currently feeling. The next time you feel trapped and don’t know how to start your journaling practice, just use the therapy journal prompts above. It will give you new ideas on things to write about. Do not over think about it and just start writing. Everything else will flow and fall into place. We hope you have enjoyed the therapy journal prompts above.

Disclaimer In-depth advice on a healthy lifestyle and coping with chronic illness Search 0 Menu About Blog Archives Resources Shop 0 Search Search 0 Menu About Blog Archives Resources Shop 0 Search 40 Journal Prompts to Help You Heal, Grow and Flourish For as long as I can remember, writing down my thoughts, hopes, dreams and plans has instantly made me feel better. So to me, it’s no surprise that journaling has so many benefits for your emotional and physical wellbeing. Trusting your deepest feelings to paper helps to reduce stress, which plays a major role in your overall health. Research shows that emotionally expressing yourself through journaling can strengthen your immunity and reduces symptoms in asthma and arthritis patients. And of course, traditional journaling is also a great tool for self-reflection and personal development, and to rewrite your personal story after traumatic events. But a diary-style of writing isn’t the only way to keep a journal. Gratitude journaling has gained a lot of popularity over the years, and it’s not hard to see why. Study after study shows that writing down 3 positive things that happened that day is one of the most effective ways to feel happier. Writing by hand also signals to your brain that ‘this is worth remembering’, which is why so many people use a journal to define their (health) goals and visions. If you write and read your dreams, plans and to-dos every day, you’ll be much more likely to actually achieve them. No matter if you’re looking to boost your health, happiness or self-growth, grab yourself a journal – I recommend the beautiful & inspiring collection from Emily McDowell – and start jotting down your thoughts with these 40 journal prompts!

Journal Prompts 50 Self Love Journal Prompts 3 Comments Self love isn’t a destination: It’s a journey. In a world that wants our self-esteem low and anxiety over our body image high, it’s incredibly hard to reach a place in your life where you’re actually content with who you are. Using self love journal prompts not only helps make this process a little easier and improves self-esteem at the same time, they also boost our self-awareness, which is always a good thing! Self love journals can be really affective for improving self-esteem, how to start a self love journal, and give you some good examples of self love journal prompts. Jump to… What is journaling for self-love? What are some good self love journal prompts? Do journal prompts work for self love? What do I write about myself in a journal? How to start a journal What is journaling for self-love? Self love is the pursuit of happiness, contentedness and wellbeing in oneself. I always say it’s not a destination, it’s a journey, because reaching a place where you’re 100% totally completely truly happy with yourself and everything about you is almost impossible. We’re always growing, adapting and changing. Plus, we’re human. We have hung-ups and insecurities that may improve but never fully go away. I’ve been working on my self love for years now and while I’m at a place where I completely respect and love myself for who I am, I don’t think I – or anyone for that matter – will ever truly reach a place of 100% self love. And that’s okay! I’m just enjoying the ride and loving myself a little more everyday. After using self love journal prompts myself, I’ve realised my self-worth. Journal prompts geared towards improving self love are – as you’ve probably guessed – journal prompts that focus on helping you on your self love journey. They help improve self-esteem, self-worth, self-acceptance, and self-awareness. They’re all about the self. Since we’re often conditioned to believe that putting ourselves first is a bad thing, isn’t it refreshing to finally spend some time working on yourself?

Why? Well, firstly, journal prompts the perfect way to get you started on your journaling ~journey~. They take out the guess work when it comes to actually sitting down and writing about yourself in your journal. (This also makes them a major stress-saver in this respect.) This means that you can simply sit down with your journal, pick a prompt, and get writing instead of faffing around over what you’re going to write about. Secondly, self love journal prompts allow you to totally focus on yourself – journaling is self-care after all – which improves self-awareness. Improving self-awareness helps you embrace who you really are at your core as a human being – shadow traits and all – which leads to a better mindset overall. What do I write about myself in a journal? Journaling is a form of self-expression, so you should always listen to your intuitive when it comes to what to write. However, using self love journal prompts is a good place to start. Journal prompts for self love will literally prompt you on what to write about yourself. They’ll get you thinking, reflecting, and observing how you feel so that you can unpack it and work on improving it. In addition to using self love journal prompts, I really recommend also looking into practising: Gratitude journaling Goal/intention-setting Writing affirmations Scheduling in self-care All these practises put together can have a life-changing, positive impact on your mindset, self-esteem, and mental health. I know because this is the method I used to improve mine! How to start a journal Starting a self love journal is much like starting any other journal aimed at personal development. I have a whole post on how to start a journal , if you want to check it out. My main steps for starting a self love journal are: Buy a pretty journal (+ stationary) that you want to pick up and write in Decide what you want to journal about other than self love (for example, gratitude, self-care, affirmations, etc) Draw/write your layout or use a journal printable that aligns with your intentions (I currently sell journal printables on my Etsy shop , if you want to take a look) Sit down to journal without distractions (I recommend doing this first thing in the morning before the world wakes up) Pick your self love journal prompt for the day (pick one that resonates with you, that you’re drawn to on that particular day, or pick one completely at random – the choice is yours) Set a timer as you journal if your time is limited Meditate afterwards to clear your mind (especially if you’ve been doing shadow work ) As well as journaling, some other tips to help improve self love that I personally use are: Practising self-care every single day without fail – I actually schedule it in Challenging negative self-talk with positive affirmations Setting boundaries, ESPECIALLY with people close to me – my energy is now sacred to me Wearing clothes that I like – not clothes that I’m expected to wear – and expressing myself through my own personal style Shadow work Forgiving and accepting myself for being human (which is part of shadow work, but worth mentioning on its own as self-compassion is scientifically proven to improve self love) Social media self-care – I unfollow anyone who makes me feel bad about myself or unworthy in any way and follow positive, kind people in their place It’s a lot. I know. It takes time. But honestly, the self-awareness and self-respect this has helped me achieve is nothing short of life-changing. I take no s***. I’m a more secure, confident person. I understand why I’m an awesome person. At the same time, I also hold myself accountable and know which areas of myself I need to work on. It’s totally worth it. I understand I’m not perfect – no-one is – and that’s okay because I’m human.

We either reject and/or repress those aspects of our personalities which we find unsavoury, and if we don’t immediately recognise the traits in ourselves for which this applies, then chances are they are indeed being repressed. But that’s okay – nobody is immune. And by being here and reading about it you’re taking the first step towards doing something positive and proactive about it. Our shadows develop primitively and instinctively as a survival mechanism, so while they may not comprise attractive qualities, they’re largely beyond our control and have served a vital purpose at some time in our past. Our shadows show up in our lives is as self-sabotage. But the fact is, they can remain hidden deep within us long beyond when they stopped serving us – and this is actually a clue to identifying our own particular shadow traits: One way in which the characteristics of our shadows show up in our lives is as self-sabotage. And let’s face it – who wouldn’t want to challenge the part of themselves that’s responsible for ruining the good in their lives? It’s a complex and uncomfortable process, but ultimately so worthwhile. Head over to my post to learn more about shadow work and how it can negatively influence your life – as well as the many benefits of actively facing your shadow self. How Do You Face Your Shadow Self? Facing your shadow self is as simple and excruciating as acknowledging and challenging your least attractive qualities. They hold power over us while we reject or repress them. Challenging our shadows is a daunting task, because it essentially means looking right into the heart of the most shameful and vulnerable parts of ourselves. But, whether we like it or not, just because we refuse to acknowledge those unattractive traits at the core of who we are, does not mean they don’t exist. What it does mean is that they hold power over us while we reject or repress them.

The next step is to acknowledge that we’re now in a position to meet that need for ourselves, if it has not already been met as we’ve grown and matured. Then it’s up to the present, adult, rational version of ourselves to identify, acknowledge, and communicate with the primitive shadow self; to bring it out into the light and show self-compassion to our younger, fallible self. How Do You Practice Shadow Work? The gold standard for intense shadow healing is through journaling. Using shadow work prompts can help with this process.

Taking yourself through this uncomfortable process will help you to accomplish your goal of finding a greater sense of calm and peace. Pin it for later: 75 Challenging Shadow Work Journal Prompts to Bring You Peace For all of the reasons outlined above, journaling is my preferred method of shadow work. Here are some powerful shadow work journaling prompts for you to work on: What do you think are the worst character traits a person can have? i) When is a time you have demonstrated these traits? How do you think people see you? i) How would they describe you? ii) How do you feel about that? What things are triggers for you? i) Consider where those irrational feelings stem from. Nobody enjoys feeling hurt, anger, rejection, betrayal, jealousy, etc. What is the very worst emotion to experience for you personally? Why? Where does that come from? What things make you judgemental? i) Think about a hypothetical situation in which you’d agree somebody could behave in a way you’d usually judge, yet be entirely innocent. When is the last time you felt let down? i) Examine how you felt and whether it was truly rational, or if you were triggered. Do you have healthy boundaries in your relationships? i) Is there any particular relationship that you feel could benefit from stronger boundaries? ii) Explore what is preventing you from having the courage to hold that space. iii) Can you say with complete honesty that you respect the boundaries of others? What makes you feel empty? How do you tend to fill that void? i) What are some healthy strategies you might develop to overcome feelings of emptiness? Who has the most influence over you? i) Is that healthy? Who do you envy? i) Why? ii) How might you be able to work towards gaining the things they have that you feel jealousy towards? Do you consider yourself to be confrontational? Why? Is this something you’re proud of or would you prefer to be different? i) Would others be more likely to describe you as confrontational or a pushover? How would you prefer to be viewed? Think of a relationship you’ve walked away from. Write down the reasons it’s been a positive life choice. Describe yourself with objectivity. i) How easy was this task? Do you know who you truly are? ii) Do you like who you are? What person has hurt you the most in your life? i) Write them a letter telling them all the things you’d like to say. What most frightens you? i) How might you be able to expose yourself to that fear in a safe way? What misconception do people have about you? i) How does that make you feel? Do you generally feel less than, better than, or equal to others? Explore this. What memories bring you shame? i) Think about who you were then, what led to your behaviour, and how you’ve changed since. ii) Now write out the words ‘I did the best I could at the time and I forgive myself’. Think again about those memories of shame. Close your eyes and take yourself back to when you were at your very worst. Relive the feelings of that time. Now look around you and see how far you’ve come. i) Consider your past self as you would perhaps a younger sibling, from a position of honesty and compassion. Write your past self a letter, demonstrating understanding and forgiveness. Which traits would you least wish to be described as having? i) Why would it be so terrible? In what ways are you similar to your parents or childhood caregivers? i) Is this a conscious decision? In what ways would you like to emulate them? ii) How do you actively choose (or try) to be different? What is your definition of failure? i) What makes these circumstances so terrible? ii) Imagine yourself in this situation. Write down five things you believe people would think about you. iii) Now write down five things you would hope people would think of you. Who regularly (or last) belittles or downplays your emotions? i) How does it make you feel? Think about unhealthy relationships you have currently or have had previously. What’s the common theme? i) Why do you think you find yourself in this kind of dynamic? ii) How can you recognise and avoid allowing this type of relationship to develop? What emotions tend to bring out the worst in you? i) Why do you think that is? When have you been self-sabotaging or destructive in your life? i) Examine how you were feeling at the time, and what triggered your behaviour. With whom or in which situations do you find yourself slipping on a mask or embodying a different persona? i) What do you think would happen if you exposed your true self? ii) How does that make you feel? Negative traits tend to develop in childhood as a defence mechanism. They’re useful at the time, but not as adults. List your least desirable traits. i) Where do they come from? i) Think about their purpose, and write about more positive and productive behaviours you could use instead. iii) Think about others you know who display these traits too, and how they make you feel. Make a promise to yourself to remember to look past the trait to the vulnerability behind it in future – we do not know other people’s stories. Think about your friendships. Which ones make you feel safe, secure, and loved? i) Do you have any in which you feel isolated, pressured, or otherwise uncomfortable? ii) Examine why this may be and if you have any negative history. How do you tend to respond to compliments? Make a concerted effort to learn to simply say ‘thank you’, if you don’t already do this. Which relationships in your life no longer serve you? Be ruthless – nobody else will see this. i) Which relationships feel obligatory or dutiful. Consider how you’d feel if you allowed those relationships to dissolve, then think about whether they’re worth trying to salvage, and how you may be able to do that. ii) Perhaps write a letter to that person/those people. What do you most dislike about yourself? i) Really examine why that is, and whether you’d feel the same level of distaste for somebody else in your position. List out your core values. i) Are you living in alignment with them? What could you change to be more in harmony with them? ii) Do they match those of your childhood caregivers? iii) If not, explore why this might be. What do you wish people understood about you? i) How might you be better able to demonstrate the quality that people tend to overlook? Do you have or have you had recurring nightmares? What’s the theme? What might it relate to? i) How might you face the fear causing your nightmare? What’s the worst way you’ve been taken advantage of in your lifetime? i) Think about the person who treated you that way, and consider their circumstances. What do you think drove them to it? ii) If you don’t know enough about them to answer this question, imagine what their story is. Write it down, keeping in mind that nobody is born evil. Terrible experiences do not excuse terrible behaviours unto others, but they can help you to forgive and make peace. Now imagine somebody else is working through the previous exercise and they are picturing you . i) Who is the person, and what did you do to them? ii) What were your circumstances at the time? Write a letter to the person explaining yourself and apologising. iii) Have you forgiven yourself? Imagine the person writing their letter to you, and then forgiving you. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale breathe out any feelings of guilt you’ve been holding onto. What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? i) What drove you to it? ii) Have you confessed to your misdemeanour? Are you afraid of being honest? iii) Examine why this is and whether it’s truly valid. iv) Are you protecting yourself or others? v) Could being open about it help to bring you peace? vi) How might you atone for it? What authority figures (individuals as opposed to institutions) did you respect growing up? i) What qualities did/do they possess? ii) Do you share those traits? How might you develop/enhance them? Without thinking too deeply, what’s your gut reaction to the question ‘Do people respect you’? i) Why do you think this is? ii) How do you feel about this? How are you letting yourself down at this time in your life? i) How could you be better to yourself? Consider your health, finances, relationships, work, etc. What lies have you previously told yourself? i) Are you being entirely truthful with yourself at this time in your life? When you are alone, what does you inner voice sound like? Is it positive or negative? i) Consider whose voice that truly is. ii) Write a letter to the person who became your inner voice, thanking them if they champion you, or challenging them if they are critical. What was your last uncharitable thought? Did you voice it? i) Was it deserved? ii) Were you being unfairly judgemental? Who do you owe an apology to? Make a list of everyone you can think of, even if it’s from a different time in your life. i) If anybody springs to mind, write them a letter. You don’t have to send it if it’s not appropriate to do so, but write it anyway. Who owes you an apology? i) Why? What did they do? Is it possible you misinterpreted the situation? ii) Write yourself a letter from their perspective, explaining the reasons for their transgression, and apologising. iii) Now take a deep breath, and as you exhale breathe out any resentment or hurt you’ve been holding onto. What’s your biggest regret in life? i) How might you be able to make peace with that? Think about your circumstances at the time and give yourself permission to be okay with the fact that you did your best at the time. What’s your worst childhood memory? i) Who was there? ii) How did they comfort you or make it worse? iii) What would you like to say to them? Perhaps write them an unsent letter. Do you have any other traumatic childhood memories? What situation in your life do you most wish had had a different outcome? i) How would it have improved your life? ii) In what ways is your life better for it not having worked out? Who do you feel inferior to? i) Objectively explore whether they have intentionally made you feel this way, or if it’s your own feelings of inadequacy creating that illusion. ii) How do you think they view you or feel about you? Why? Who has let you down the most in your life? i) Are they still around? How do you feel about that? What’s the worst character trait you have as a result of your childhood? i) What or who do you think caused it? ii) How do you feel about that? What are your parents’ best/worst attributes? i) How are you alike/unlike them? What is the worst emotion somebody could provoke in you? For example, anger, betrayal, jealousy. i) Why do you feel so strongly about this? ii) Does your answer differ according to the person in question? Think about a time you were manipulative. Explore the feeling behind the behaviour – what need made you behave that way? Have you overcome that feeling? How do you feel about your childhood? i) Was it generally positive or negative? ii) Who made you feel safe and who let you down? iii) Who were you close to? How does drama make you feel? i) Are you dramatic yourself? ii) Do people call you dramatic? How do you feel about this? Which of your traits do you find it difficult to accept? Explore why this is. i) Do you accept these traits in others? Do others readily accept these traits? ii) Think of somebody who shares this characteristic with you. Write down three things you admire about them. iii) This trait does not define you; write down three ways that you are more than this characteristic. Who do you hold a grudge against? i) What is stopping you from letting it go? Think about a time you felt betrayed. Have you made peace with the person involved? Write them a letter explaining how it made you feel, and forgiving them. Thinking about the previous exercise; now consider when you may have behaved similarly. Has the person involved treated you as though you betrayed them? Either way, write them a letter apologising. Who have you previously had conflict with and allegedly resolved it, but you remain wary of since? i) How did they make you feel? ii) What worries you about the relationship now? How do you view asking for help? i) Is it a sign of strength or weakness? Why is this? What makes you self-conscious around others? Who dislikes you or treats you poorly or with disrespect? i) How does it make you feel? ii) Where does this attitude or behaviour come from? iii) Being very honest, is it deserved? Do you owe this person an apology? iv) If you do, write them a letter apologising sincerely, or reach out in some other way. v) Write this sentence down ten times: Other people’s opinions of me are none of my business. What makes you feel unsafe? Explore this. What could have made your childhood better? How do you feel about that? What one thing could somebody say to you to bring you to your knees? i) Why do those words hold so much power? ii) How can you begin to take the power out of those words? Who have you most let down in your lifetime, and how/why did it happen? i) Have you made peace with the situation? ii) Write a letter to the person you disappointed telling them how you feel, even if you don’t send it. What does freedom mean to you? What in your life gives you the most purpose? Think about the people closest to you. What would you change about them, if you could, to improve your relationship (perhaps something to do with the way you resolve conflicts)? i) How does that reflect on you? ii) Based on this exercise, is there anything you could consider improving in yourself to help? What makes you feel most valued? What would you most like to be recognised for? Now available as a free printable in two great designs!

Some Background on Shadow Work… Shadow work is an intense form of inner work, based on Jung’s theory of the shadow. Read more about shadow work . Shadows tend to develop as a reaction to painful experiences from our past. The character traits we develop are primitive – and not attractive qualities and for this reason we repress or deny them. This allows them to live as shadows in our unconscious, where they tend to negatively influence our behaviours without our conscious knowledge or understanding. While the existence of our shadow parts makes sense in terms their capacity to offer self-preservation, in the wider context of our day to day lives, they do not serve us well. Spending time actively seeking out and illuminating our shadow can effectively remove its power. Shadows are often expressed via projection, and you may recognise elements of yours by observing specific people or situations which trigger strong or unpleasant feelings in you. Left unchecked our shadows can lead to self-sabotaging behaviours such as: Jealousy Resentment Bitterness Anger and aggression Addiction Guilt and shame However, spending time actively seeking out and illuminating our shadow can effectively remove its power. You can achieve this through shadow work exercises , with shadow work journaling being one of the best options. Benefits of a Shadow Work Journal Journaling is an excellent method to practice any kind of inner work, for several reasons: Writing is cathartic, Journaling provides a record for you to reflect back on, Journaling can be used alongside most other forms of shadow work, Writing also reinforces the thing you are writing about.

Each prompt is intended to either draw out painful memories, or force you to confront unpleasant truths about yourself. The process may feel uncomfortable, but that simply means it’s working. Letting go of the pain we’re holding onto in order to live a more peaceful life is the foundation of shadow work. The theory is that by practicing shadow work and acknowledging your shadow traits, you’re able to unify your conscious and unconscious, and reconcile with the elements of yourself you’ve either repressed or denied. The ultimate goal is to live a more balanced and peaceful life. Prefer a fancier shadow work journal with charming doodles? You’ll love our illustrated design instead!

They may also help you to recognise painful truths about relationships which you’ve repressed or denied. And, crucially, to consider what you learn from a non-judgemental perspective. We can’t control others, we can only control ourselves, and this is the foundation of shadow work: Awareness and acceptance of our faults and limitations, forgiving ourselves and others, and letting go of the pain we’re holding onto in order to live a more peaceful life. 680 shares By Author Kate Tunstall Posted on Last updated: December 3, 2021 Categories Journaling , Personal Growth Home » Personal Growth » 75 Shadow Work Journal Prompts to Help You Realise Your True Potential Tags Journal Prompts Shadow Work Post navigation The Positive Way to Stop Your Child From Sulking 113 Self Loving Affirmations + 33 Quotes About Self Worth to Boost Your Self-Esteem Click here to cancel reply.

            "60 Deep Shadow Work Prompts to Heal, Grow & Find Yourself MONEY DECOR PLANTS & GARDEN FOOD KIDS LIFESTYLE Select Page 60 Deep Shadow Work Prompts to Heal, Grow & Find Yourself Sep 16, 2021 | LIFESTYLE Do you feel as though there are deeper layers of yourself that are just waiting to be unearthed? Do you have a deeper desire to know more about who you are – who you really are – at a core and soul level? Do you sometimes wonder why you think, act and feel the way you do and have a yearning to understand what it is that triggers those exact choices, decisions and thoughts? These are undeniably complex but interesting questions that appear when we have a deep desire to address the unconscious, deeply buried aspect of our personality. Aka the shadow self. In this guide, we’ll embark on the journey to meet our shadow self through deep shadow work prompts and questions. Then, we’ll discuss what we can do with the shadow side of ourselves so that it has a positive and real world impact in our lives. Word of warning, shadow work isn’t to be taken lightly. It can trigger unhealed trauma, challenging and complex thoughts as well as existential crises in some people. That said, it’s also a life changing technique and tool that can be used for intense healing, growth and self discovery. As a psychotherapist in training, you’re in good hands, but I feel it’s my duty to give you fair warning before proceeding. The shadow work prompts are designed to become progressively more ‘heavy-duty’ as you work down the list, though all are fairly challenging. If at any point you feel it’s become too much – stop, process what you’ve already uncovered and then return when you feel emotionally equipped and stable to do so. Let’s get started. SO WHAT IS THE SHADOW SELF EXACTLY? There are a LOT of layers to the shadow self, but in simple terms, the shadow self is everything that is not fully integrated with the conscious aspect of our ego or reality. It houses everything you repressed and ‘brushed off’ during your childhood and early adulthood as a form of psychological protection in order to fit in, be loved or be accepted. In other words, you can view the shadow side of yourself as the irrational, wounded, instinctive child-like part of your personality, the part of you that can harbor anything from intense rage to profound inferiority. In some way, your shadow self is like a wild animal in that it represents that side of us that we choose not to ‘let loose’ in society for fear of abandonment, judgement or criticism. Here’s where it gets interesting though. The shadow self is neither negative nor positive, though you may have read that the shadow self carries inherently negative traits (which kind of is AND isn’t true). In some people, the shadow self is largely made up of repressed, rejected and least desirable qualities of themselves which is why it often gets a bad rap. In others (especially those suffering from low self esteem, low self confidence, impostor syndrome etc), the shadow side is a powerhouse of false beliefs internalized from past experiences and traumas that continues to dominate their waking life. In either case, confronting the shadow self face to face gives us an opportunity to identify and heal faulty beliefs, the wounded inner child and have many breakthrough moments that allow us to make progress in all areas of our life. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO DO SHADOW WORK? Shadow work is the intensely personal, but deeply gratifying process of journeying within to meet the darkest, most repressed side of yourself. It requires compassion, kindness, patience and a need to let go of any assumptions or expectations – not to mention letting go of always being in control. Shadow work doesn’t work when you’re actively trying to hide and deny the feelings and thoughts that bubble up. You absolutely need to be comfortable with confronting the weirdest, most illogical, most terrifying, irrational parts of yourself – the parts of you that feel wounded and sad. The parts of you that feel anguish and despair. The parts of you that acknowledge you were treated unfairly and so want to scream about the injustice in the world. The parts of you that feel as though you’re living a life of ‘fakeness’. Shadow work attempts to dig deep to understand what thoughts, feelings, memories and emotional processes were buried in an attempt to protect and preserve the conscious part of your reality.  Anything that makes you feel uneasy or uncomfortable is likely a good place to start. Fun fact: you can’t heal what you aren’t aware of. BEFORE YOU START Before you dive deep into these prompts, I want you to practice and uphold a self care practice. You might think you’re fully capable of handling what arises from a ‘few simple questions’, but before you know it, your answer has affected you all day and you can’t stop thinking about it. These moments will happen – it’s normal. It’s also normal to feel a sense of detachment with the world and those around you for a little while, at least until you’ve processed what came up for you. Give yourself some space to breathe. Shadow work will never be complete, it’s something that follows you (just like your shadow) on the journey that is life. It can wait until you’re ready to pick it up again. 60 DEEP HEALING SHADOW WORK PROMPTS TO BRING YOU PEACE Which emotion makes me feel the most uneasy or uncomfortable to sit with? Which one do I try to avoid the most? Think back to a scenario or situation where that emotion played out. What happened? How did I react initially? What other emotions played out alongside the one I tried to avoid? What negative emotions am I most comfortable with? Do I cling to certain emotions on a day to day basis because they feel ‘normal’? Is your inner voice kind or critical? What things does it say to you on a typical day? Is your inner voice truly yours? Who’s voice could be influencing your inner voice? (Parents, partners, teachers, friends etc). Would you say the things that that voice tells you to other people? If no, then those thoughts aren’t your true voice. They’re reflections of other people’s beliefs you’ve internalized. ‘I am easily influenced or swayed by the opinions and beliefs of others. I find it hard to assert my own voice and figure out what is them versus me’. Explore this statement. ‘I regularly downplay how I feel or what I’m really thinking for the sake of others’. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Looking at your past, who has or still does regularly downplay how you feel? Why do you let people who don’t acknowledge your feelings stay in your life? Do you have a desire to keep their company? Or, do you know that there’s something you could be doing too to make the relationship better? Do I value myself and what I bring to the table? How can I be kinder to myself? In what ways do I punish or sabotage myself? How important am I to myself? Have you ever done something just to make someone else feel proud of you? If so, who was it and why? Do you fully celebrate your achievements? Or, is there a disconnect between your achievements and who you are as a person? Which one resonates more? What is your biggest regret to date? Imagine you’re coming to the end of your life, what is the biggest regret you fear having the most? How does that make you feel and where does it sit within the body? Imagine your worst fear came true, how does that now make you feel about your life ahead? Imagine your most wanted dream came true right now, how does that make you feel about your life ahead? Are there similar feelings and emotions tied to both your fears and successes? Do you feel you’re only as ‘good as your last achievement’? If yes, why? If no, why not? What do you think are your most undesirable traits and characteristics? (This is NOT an opportunity to put yourself down but rather a chance to unearth what you believe to be true about yourself. This doesn’t mean what you write is an accurate reflection of yourself). What image do you think other people carry about you? How would you like others to describe you? Is there a difference between your answer to this question and the previous one? How does that make you feel? ‘If I could be anything in the world, I would be …..’ fill in the blank. Why aren’t you already doing the thing you mentioned in the above question? What’s stopping you? What is my definition of failure? When I think back to a time that I failed, I feel …. Fill in the blank. What is my definition of perfection? Is it attainable? Do I hold myself to a higher standard than others? If so, why? In what areas of my life do I feel inferior to others? Have I ever sacrificed a part of myself to fit in with others better? Where am I playing small in my life? What narrative or stories do I tell myself surrounding ‘wanting more’? If I could tell my younger self only one thing, it would be …. Fill in the blank. When have you ever felt abandoned by those around you? Describe the situation and what it made you feel. How do I show up for others in ways that I don’t show up for myself? What do you need to forgive yourself for? What is the thing you feel most guilty for in your life to date? ‘I am overly critical and harsh on myself’. Do you agree or disagree with this statement and why? ‘I feel the need to keep myself hidden and small for the sake of others’ feelings’. Explore this statement. ‘I’ve stayed in relationships (either platonic or romantic) that deep down I knew weren’t good for me. Why did I do that?’ Explore this statement and the feelings it brings up. ‘I am worthy of good things coming my way’. Do you agree or disagree and why? If you were to live the remaining years of your life as an exact repeat of what has gone by, how would you feel and why? Where would you make changes? Describe the time when you felt the most alone. ‘In the past I have let people take advantage of me’. Explore this statement. Does acknowledging that other people have taken advantage of you bring up any anger, resentment or uncomfortableness? If you could turn back the clocks, what would you do differently? Where do you need to set better boundaries in your life? Did your parents always address and meet your needs as a child? Did your teachers and school peers treat you with the respect and love you deserved as a child? Thinking back to a time in my childhood when I felt different or outcast, do I notice any similarities in that moment to how I go about my daily life now? Are there childhood fears appearing in my adult life? What makes you really angry, so angry that you don’t tell anyone or you internalize and bury it? What is my inner truth? If I had to take a negative experience and reframe it positively, how would I do that? How does the process of reframing make me feel? What is my deepest source of rage and anger? What can’t I accept about myself? What do I hate about others? What do I need to stop running away from? What do I struggle to tackle head on? What is the greatest lie I keep feeding myself with? Where has that come from? How far have I come in life? What does happiness mean to me? Who am I? WHAT DO I DO WITH MY ANSWERS? Each of these shadow work questions were designed to help you become more self-aware. The simple act of writing down your true, unfiltered thoughts and reactions to these questions means you’ve achieved that goal. But what you do next with all of this information depends on your personal goal. Some are happy to leave shadow work in their journal and use it as a trusty tool to rediscover themselves after periods of confusion or overwhelm. Others like to dig deeper and implement changes (both big and small) into their lives as a result of what they discovered during their journaling sessions. Either approach is valid. The key to making changes as a result of shadow work lies in your ability to analyse your answer to figure out the core theme or emotion lurking underneath. Then, taking that emotion and trying to connect it with a past experience, traumatic event or time when a belief was challenged is the next logical step in the healing process. Note, there will be times when you say ‘I don’t know where that came from’, and that’s perfectly normal. From my own experience, and the observation of my trainee counselling sessions with clients, these answers and connections will come to you at the most random of times. Once you’ve gained some kind of understanding of your answer and where it came from, it’s time to decide how you move forward with this information; do you pick a new path, do you choose a new perspective, do you vow to practice more self care, do you forgive yourself? Whatever you choose, it’s important to be as gentle as possible with yourself. MY EXPERIENCE WITH SHADOW WORK I first delved into the realm of shadow work through journaling a few years ago. I was feeling completely lost, overwhelmed and apathetic with life. I had an unexplainable crushing and sinking feeling that was slowly draining all the enthusiasm and love out of me, amongst many other things. And so, the logical and analytical part of my mind wanted to know the ‘whys’. Surface level solutions and simple answers didn’t cut it for me. I knew something was triggering all of this, but what? That’s when I decided to take a good hard look at the aspects of myself that I buried for years on end. How unresolved traumas and past experiences were still playing out in my life. It was through these very shadow work prompts and questions that I had many ‘aha’ moments of realisation. Whilst not everything had an answer (and it never will – something I found hard to accept), I discovered that we suppress and continue to suppress what feels unacceptable to our innermost being out of fear of what we might discover. ‘Shadow Work is the Path of the Heart Warrior’ – Carl Jung Share: Previous The Meaning of a Spider: Spiritual Symbolism & Message Next Angel Number 737: Unlocking Your Message From the Universe Related Posts 19 Starseed Types: Which Star System is Your Soul Really From?

Unlike other practices like meditation which is hard to master, journaling is simple enough for anyone to choose and take advantage of. Extensive scientific research and studies have established the effectiveness of journaling for physical and mental health. Therapists and psychologists recommend journaling for healing emotional trauma. Journaling or writing may not be the strong point for many people, especially those suffering from emotional issues. This doesn’t mean they cannot benefit from the exercise. That is where prompts can help out. Journaling prompts are ideas that nudge your mind into thinking in a particular direction. Once you have your thoughts figured out, all you need to do is write them down in the journal. It is as simple as that! This article explores the benefits of journaling and using prompts to make the exercise further simpler. You will find here a list of guided journal prompts that can help in emotional self-awareness and self-healing. 30 Journal Prompts for Emotional Healing Why should you consider journaling?

Professional writers use prompts to help them overcome writer’s block. Even full-time writers encounter roadblocks while expressing themselves. Sitting down every day with the journal open in front of you and the pen poised for writing, you may be at a loss of ideas, topics, and words. Finding a new topic to write about every day is no easy task for most people. When you take time out of your busy daily schedule for journaling, you may find it difficult to switch channels and direct your thoughts in the right direction. Many abandon journaling because of this. Self-discovery journal prompts offer a simple solution to the problem. Mindful journal prompts are ideas, questions, and statements that can trigger certain thought processes and direct your mind along a particular way of thinking. Once you start focusing on something, it would be easier to go deeper and develop the thought and get to the bottom of it. When you are clear about what you want to write, words will start pouring out without hesitation.

What would you like to change in your life if you can time-travel to your childhood? – This helps you identify your regrets and disappointments. How easy is it for you to admit your mistakes? – If you have trouble putting it into words, you can answer the question on a scale of 1 – 10. What do you think is the reason? How often is your “no” ignored or overlooked?  – Do you think you are emphatic enough? Or is it because of the overbearing nature of others? What motivates you to chase your dreams? – Is it your ambitious nature or are you just going with the flow? Concluding thoughts Journaling can offer the best results when practiced daily. Set aside a time exclusively for the exercise, making sure that you will be undisturbed. You can start small with 5 minutes a day and increase it as you feel necessary. You can also use journaling to deal with traumatic and stressful events. When you feel that you are losing control of your emotions and would like to avoid emotional outbursts, you can sit down immediately for a session of journaling. Once you pour your emotions out onto the pages of the journal, you would feel a strange calmness and peace descend on your mind. When emotions run riot in your mind, grab your journal and pen and get down to journaling. Whichever way you look at this, it is magical.

Journal Prompts 60 Days of Shadow Work Journal Prompts For Healing, Self-Awareness & Growth 1 Comment Shadow work journal prompts are an amazing way for beginners to improve self-awareness and work through past traumas, events, and emotions, as well to get to know themselves as human beings much better. Discovering and exploring your shadow self so that you can learn self-acceptance, boundaries, and healthy coping mechanisms is a form of self-care in itself and, to be completely honest, it’s been completely life-changing for me. Shadow work has totally changed my mindset and improved my mental health. Knowing where to start can be tricky though – I totally get that, which is why using journal prompts to get started can be really helpful. Jump to… What is shadow work? 60 days of shadow work prompts for beginners Why should we use shadow work prompts? What does shadow work mean spiritually? How do I find my shadow self? How to do Shadow Work What is a shadow work journal? How do you use shadow work prompts and questions? What is shadow work? The term ‘shadow work’ refers to the practice of working through and learning to forgive your shadow self. Your shadow self is the side of you that you tend to hide from others and keep out of sight, hence the name. The Shadow is one of main archetypes that Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, focused on the most, along with the Self, the Persona, and the Anima/Animus. These archetypes are defined as universal, primal symbols and images that derive from the collective unconscious. Jung’s Shadow archetype is often likened to Sigmund Freud’s theory on the Id. In 1923, Freud theorised that the human psyche is comprised of three parts: the Id, the Ego, and the Superego. The Id according to Freud, was the primitive part of the psyche responsible for sexual and aggressive drives, as well as hidden memories. The Superego is the moral conscious, while the Ego acts as the go-between. Freud’s Id and Jung’s Shadow contrast in certain aspects because Jung believed that not all Shadow traits were inherently negative and could even result in creativity, while Freud believed that the Id was primitive and purely driven by instinct. According to Jung, our Shadow is the side of us that the ego doesn’t identify with; the ‘darker’ side of our personality. While the traits that make up our Shadow as usually perceived to be negative – as our ego has hidden them for a reason – they can also be positive, as having low self-esteem or anxiety can cause us to unnecessarily reject certain aspects of ourselves that we’ve been taught are bad. For example being extroverted, impulsive, and fantasising can also be part of the Shadow, but aren’t necessarily negative traits. Some of us as children are just taught that we should be quiet, timid, and rational, and therefore view these as traits that we should bury. ‘Modern’ shadow work refers to discovering these shadow traits, forgiving ourselves for them, healing from past trauma that may have caused them, and processing them in order to grow. We tend to see shadow traits in other people pretty easily, but when it comes to our own shadow self, it takes a little introspection. Shadow traits that your shadow side might possess include: Anger/Outbursts of rage Envious/Jealous Manipulative/Exploitative Selfish/Self-centred Arrogant/Egotistical Obsessed with appearance/how other people see them/dependent on praise Intolerant Judgemental Defensive Overly competitive Stubborn Shadow work is basically a deep-dive – usually through meditation and journaling – into what makes us tick and why. Our shadow self usually begins to develop in childhood when we’re especially susceptible to soaking up the attitudes and energies of our environment, as well as experience trauma that we’re not yet equipped to deal with. With this in mind, shadow work can be really, really uncomfortable – TRUST me. You have to be vulnerable and super-honest with yourself, and that doesn’t always feel good. After all, this is why we’ve suppressed and hidden this shadow self for so long. (This is why I put together a Shadow Work for Beginners workbook to make the process a little less overwhelming.) Thinking about our upbringing, environment growing up, trauma, and parents’ impact on our entire being because of their own toxic traits is also an immensely humbling experience. You finally realise that the people who raised you are also human and also have their own shadow selves. This was a tough pill for me to swallow, but that’s for me to unpack during my own shadow work. Saying all this: Learning about who you are as a person – warts and all – as well as how you’ve acquired your toxic traits and how to work through them is SO rewarding and useful. Eventually, the goal is for you to learn to forgive yourself for your shadow traits, come to realise why you have these less desirable attributes, accept the sides of yourself that you might have kept hidden in the past, and move into a much happier, more accepting mindset. Humans aren’t perfect and we should never stop learning, especially about ourselves. Shadow work is ultimately deep-diving into your own toxic traits and why they came about. It helps us learn about who we REALLY are as people, grow, and reach true self-acceptance. Figuring out how to recognise, process, and work on my shadow traits going forward is now one of my most crucial parts of self-care .

By suppressing our shadow selves, we’re not learning to work through our issues and become better human beings, we’re simply allowing our certain traits to fester and grow. Jung believed that this would result in the Shadow taking charge and pushing other, inauthentic traits to the surface, as well as projecting these unwanted traits onto other people, which can hamper relationships. This is not only exhausting, it can cause mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as we wrestle with the parts of ourselves we don’t want others to see, and, as a result, fail to work through them. We learn to resent and hate these parts of ourselves, which impacts our mindset and self-esteem, and can even affect how we treat others, as well as ourselves. For me, learning how to notice my shadow traits, understand them, work through them and forgive them has been amazing for my mindset and mental health. Processing emotions in a healthy way as they arise and the concept of ‘feeling to heal’ in general has been difficult for me. I tend to like to gloss over, hide and stuff down anything negative, which results in toxicity rearing its head later on. Learning where my toxic, shadow traits have come from, how to work through them, and ultimately forgiving myself for being human has been liberating and uplifting. Therefore, while challenging, recognising, accepting, and unpacking my toxic traits has been nothing short of life-changing. I found that a lot of the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues that I experienced were the result of me not working through my shit properly. I now include shadow work in my self-care routine. Self-care is calling yourself out on your own bullshit and learning how to deal with it, as well as self-awareness, self-love, processing past trauma, identifying and dealing with triggers, and self-acceptance. What does shadow work mean spiritually? While I’m a firm believer that you don’t need to be spiritual to practise shadow work since learning self-acceptance and positive coping mechanisms is basically free therapy*, shadow work is closely linked with connecting with your true, higher self. Shadow work is thought to raise your frequency, which means that you’ll align with and attract better things, and manifest your dreams more easily through the Law of Attraction. However, as I said, shadow work isn’t just for those looking to reach a high state of consciousness, it can also be an amazing act of self-care and self-awareness. *While I would never advise against therapy, I’m also very aware that good therapists are not accessible, available, or affordable to most people, which is one of the reasons I started this blog in the first place. Another practise that’s closely linked with spirituality is repeating positive affirmations. I have a whole post on shadow work affirmations , if you want to check it out. How do I find my shadow self? Carl Jung believed that we encounter the Shadow in our dreams. However, most people find that a combination of daily meditation to help mindfulness and keeping a shadow work journal for introspection and soul-searching is the best way to get in touch with their shadow self. If you’re new to shadow work – or even if you’re not, to be honest – shadow work prompts can be amazingly useful when it comes to accessing past emotions and memories in order to work through them. Often, just writing stuff down can feel really cathartic, as if you’re literally pulling the toxic thoughts from your mind and pinning them to paper. When talking to your shadow self, my top tips in order to get the most out of your shadow work prompts are: Be totally authentic and honest – even if this feels uncomfortable. Dig deep into your emotions – no one has to ever read what you’re writing, so let it spill onto the page. Embrace any unexpected thoughts/emotions that come up and write about them too (if you need to cry, CRY! We embrace emo hours here!). Write down everything – even if you don’t think it’s important now, it might be later. Use shadow work journal prompts to get you started and help the thoughts flow. Recognise your shadow traits from your responses to the shadow work questions. Meditate before shadow work to help boost mindfulness and after to calm your mind. Practise self-care afterwards. Don’t pressure yourself to write lots if it doesn’t feel right. Be gentle and forgiving with yourself – you’re only human. Shadow work is exactly that: work. You’re treating wounds that still haven’t fully closed from childhood and learning to face the demons that don’t just reside in you but are PART of you after years of suppression. This isn’t easy and it’s certainly not fun, but it is rewarding. As humans, we’re all works in progress. None of us are perfect. Learning how to deal with our own shadow self is immensely personal, so I’ve tried to make my top tips as general as possible. True shadow work takes time, perseverance, bravery, honesty, and self-awareness. How to do Shadow Work The best way to do shadow work, in my opinion, is by using shadow work prompts. One of the main ways to practise shadow work is through introspection: asking yourself deep questions that delve into your past, analysing your way of thinking, and digging for answers that you don’t particularly want to uncover. This is where true healing and growth occurs. Most people can’t do this on the fly, which is why using shadow work questions or prompts comes in handy. All you need to do is grab a blank notebook or journal (this Paperage one on Amazon is great if you’re on a budget), make a note of the journal prompts in this blog post, and choose one to get started. They get your thinking and, if you keep a shadow work journal, can help you sort through your shadow traits, where they come from, and how to move forward. Other methods of shadow work include: Meditation Self-awareness when negative feelings occur (asking yourself what exactly you’re feeling, why this is, and where this feeling comes from is really beneficial) Taking responsibility (while also practising forgiveness) Practising empathy and seeing yourself from other perspectives Being honest with yourself What is a shadow work journal? A shadow work journal is a journal you have for shadow work. (Shocking, I know.) It doesn’t need to be anything special – just a plain notepad that you keep separate and safe will do. It’s totally up to you whether you share your shadow journal with other people. You might want to discuss it with a therapist or trusted person; you might not even want to tell a single soul. How do you use shadow work prompts and questions? While shadow work journal prompts are optional, they’re REALLY helpful when it comes to getting you started, whether you’re a beginner or not. Shadow work can feel like a bit of a vague term when you’re a beginner and sometimes knowing where to even begin in your journey can feel like an impossible task. This is where the shadow work prompts come in. These journal prompts are designed to trigger emotions, memories and experiences – often from childhood – that still unconsciously or consciously affect you to this day. The prompts will then encourage you to expand on this feeling, thought or story so that you can further understand where it originates, how its manifested in potentially toxic traits today, and therefore how to understand yours thoughts, actions, and boundaries going forward. Some shadow work prompts will ask you to dive deeper than others and may feel really uncomfortable, which is why I encourage you to practise meditation and self-care afterwards in order to process anything that’s come up and calm your mind. Shadow work printables are even better because they have the exercises and prompts already down on paper for you. All you have to do is print them out and fill them in. I have a whole Shadow Work for Beginners workbook if you want a little extra help getting started with your journey. When you get the workbook today, you get: 17 pages of info, prompts, and exercises on shadow work for beginners Worksheets for healing and nurturing your inner child Self-soothing and self-care checklist Shadow work affirmations Basically everything I’ve used for my shadow work that I think is crucial for beginners. My Shadow Work for Beginners Workbook is currently available, if you want to check it out. As well as using shadow work worksheets and/or my workbook for beginners, be sure to hold yourself accountable and call yourself out on your own bullshit if you catch yourself engaging in toxic behaviours, especially if they affect other people. Furthermore, don’t just call yourself out in the moment, but explore why you’ve reacted or felt the way you have. Is this something you need to work on? Journal about how you can deal with similar situations in the future. For example, if you’ve lashed out at someone close to you for a seemingly irrational reason (that will probably make total sense to you after journaling), how can you react in a calmer, more rational way if this happens again? This is how real growth is made.

Journaling is a great way to explore your feelings and process emotions. It can be therapeutic for people who may not have the opportunity to talk about their issues in an open space or feel like they’re getting the help they need from other sources. With trauma being so common in today’s society, it is vital for everyone to work on their emotional health in order to lead a more fulfilling life. Memories and wounds have a lot in common. They can be painful, but they’re also a part of who we are as individuals: They are our pasts, the influences that shaped us into people with different perspectives. This isn’t something to be fought against; it’s an important part of character-building. Accepting the things as they are, begins the healing process, making the journey of overcoming physical and emotional pain easier. Healing journal prompts offer a new range of ways to explore how you are feeling, what’s going on in your life, and what you want to change. Table of Contents Benefits of Journal Prompts Powerful Journal Prompts for Emotional Healing Healing Journal Prompts Bottom Line Benefits of Journal Prompts Journaling can be a very therapeutic and effective way to accelerate your emotional healing. Journaling will help you to think more critically about your life. It could help you identify patterns in your behavior, which can lead to self-improvement. Writing down thoughts and feelings helps us process them better than if we kept them inside of our heads ( 1 ) . Journaling can be a great way to organize one’s thoughts or get inspiration for something new. Journaling can help you feel more in control of your life. It can be a great outlet for expressing your thoughts and feelings. It’s an excellent way to get things off your chest and talk about what’s bothering you. Writing down thoughts as they come to mind helps with problem-solving. Journaling is also a form of physical activity which provides health benefits such as reduced stress levels, improved sleep quality, increased energy levels, stronger immune system response, etc. Tip : When journaling, it’s important to focus on the positive aspects of your life as well – not just the negative things that happen. This will help bring positivity into your thoughts and feelings so that they can build up rather than tearing down with everyday stressors or tough situations. Powerful Journal Prompts for Emotional Healing Checking in with yourself makes you more self-aware, and writing down your thoughts allows you to work through whatever is on your mind. How do you feel about yourself today? What is one thing that you’re grateful for this week? What’s something that has been weighing on your mind lately? What is something you would love to do but aren’t sure you can? Write about a childhood memory that has stuck with you. List 3 things you are grateful for in life. What’s something you’ve been putting of lately? List three things that make your day better, and why they make it better? What is the most important thing you have learned about yourself in the past year? Write a letter to someone who has hurt or disappointed you. (You don’t have to send it to them.) Who are some people who taught or showed unconditional love to you, and how has that impacted your life today? What do you want for your future? Think about someone who has hurt you badly in life. Find a way to understand them and forgive them. (So you can heal your mind.) What would your life be like if one small change had been made years ago (for example, if you hadn’t gone to college)? Write down five things that make up your identity (personality traits, hobbies, etc.) You might enjoy: 25 Healing Affirmations for Toxic Relationships Healing Journal Prompts Write down about a time when you were feeling out of place or uncomfortable in your own skin but then found yourself through the experience. When was the last time someone made you feel special and valued? What has been on your mind recently, and why has it bothered you so much? Make a list of three things about yourself that bring you joy or relief. How can you make this week a better one than last? What are some of your favorite memories from when you were younger and what lessons did they teach you? Do you have any regrets about how you’ve lived your life so far? Write about an event that made you feel happy. Write about an event that made you feel sad. Make an emotional list of all the things that make you happy or sad. What advice would you give yourself if you had the chance to go back in time and talk to your younger self when you were struggling with life’s problems? What can I do to make a positive difference in my life? Make a list of goals you want to achieve in life. Is there anyone with whom you’d like to spend less time because they’re toxic ? What do I love the most about myself? Rather than fighting the pain, we can choose to let it go. Letting go of wounds and painful memories will allow us to experience pure love and peace within ourselves. Bottom Line Journaling is a great way to release emotions and get in a better headspace. The use of journal prompts for emotional healing is critical in overcoming such challenges and achieving inner peace. Make journaling a part of your daily life. This will help heal any emotional wounds that may have been caused by negativity from others or internally. Sharing is caring!

Shadow Work Journal Printable in Illustrated Design The Benefit of Shadow Work Questions Everything You Need to Know About Shadow Work Prompts For Healing If you’ve not come across the term ‘shadow work’ before then here’s a little more about what you need to know before getting started with shadow work questions and prompts… We All Have a Shadow Our shadow, a term coined by psychologist Carl Jung, is the part of ourselves which we hide – or may not even be aware of. We either reject and/or repress those aspects of our personalities which we find unsavoury, and if we don’t immediately recognise the traits in ourselves for which this applies, then chances are they are indeed being repressed. But that’s okay – nobody is immune. And by being here and reading about it you’re taking the first step towards doing something positive and proactive about it. Our shadows develop primitively and instinctively as a survival mechanism, so while they may not comprise attractive qualities, they’re largely beyond our control and have served a vital purpose at some time in our past. Our shadows show up in our lives is as self-sabotage. But the fact is, they can remain hidden deep within us long beyond when they stopped serving us – and this is actually a clue to identifying our own particular shadow traits: One way in which the characteristics of our shadows show up in our lives is as self-sabotage. And let’s face it – who wouldn’t want to challenge the part of themselves that’s responsible for ruining the good in their lives? It’s a complex and uncomfortable process, but ultimately so worthwhile. Head over to my post to learn more about shadow work and how it can negatively influence your life – as well as the many benefits of actively facing your shadow self. How Do You Face Your Shadow Self? Facing your shadow self is as simple and excruciating as acknowledging and challenging your least attractive qualities. They hold power over us while we reject or repress them. Challenging our shadows is a daunting task, because it essentially means looking right into the heart of the most shameful and vulnerable parts of ourselves. But, whether we like it or not, just because we refuse to acknowledge those unattractive traits at the core of who we are, does not mean they don’t exist. What it does mean is that they hold power over us while we reject or repress them.

The next step is to acknowledge that we’re now in a position to meet that need for ourselves, if it has not already been met as we’ve grown and matured. Then it’s up to the present, adult, rational version of ourselves to identify, acknowledge, and communicate with the primitive shadow self; to bring it out into the light and show self-compassion to our younger, fallible self. How Do You Practice Shadow Work? The gold standard for intense shadow healing is through journaling. Using shadow work prompts can help with this process.

Pin it for later: 75 Challenging Shadow Work Journal Prompts to Bring You Peace For all of the reasons outlined above, journaling is my preferred method of shadow work. Here are some powerful shadow work journaling prompts for you to work on: What do you think are the worst character traits a person can have? i) When is a time you have demonstrated these traits? How do you think people see you? i) How would they describe you? ii) How do you feel about that? What things are triggers for you? i) Consider where those irrational feelings stem from. Nobody enjoys feeling hurt, anger, rejection, betrayal, jealousy, etc. What is the very worst emotion to experience for you personally? Why? Where does that come from? What things make you judgemental? i) Think about a hypothetical situation in which you’d agree somebody could behave in a way you’d usually judge, yet be entirely innocent. When is the last time you felt let down? i) Examine how you felt and whether it was truly rational, or if you were triggered. Do you have healthy boundaries in your relationships? i) Is there any particular relationship that you feel could benefit from stronger boundaries? ii) Explore what is preventing you from having the courage to hold that space. iii) Can you say with complete honesty that you respect the boundaries of others? What makes you feel empty? How do you tend to fill that void? i) What are some healthy strategies you might develop to overcome feelings of emptiness? Who has the most influence over you? i) Is that healthy? Who do you envy? i) Why? ii) How might you be able to work towards gaining the things they have that you feel jealousy towards? Do you consider yourself to be confrontational? Why? Is this something you’re proud of or would you prefer to be different? i) Would others be more likely to describe you as confrontational or a pushover? How would you prefer to be viewed? Think of a relationship you’ve walked away from. Write down the reasons it’s been a positive life choice. Describe yourself with objectivity. i) How easy was this task? Do you know who you truly are? ii) Do you like who you are? What person has hurt you the most in your life? i) Write them a letter telling them all the things you’d like to say. What most frightens you? i) How might you be able to expose yourself to that fear in a safe way? What misconception do people have about you? i) How does that make you feel? Do you generally feel less than, better than, or equal to others? Explore this. What memories bring you shame? i) Think about who you were then, what led to your behaviour, and how you’ve changed since. ii) Now write out the words ‘I did the best I could at the time and I forgive myself’. Think again about those memories of shame. Close your eyes and take yourself back to when you were at your very worst. Relive the feelings of that time. Now look around you and see how far you’ve come. i) Consider your past self as you would perhaps a younger sibling, from a position of honesty and compassion. Write your past self a letter, demonstrating understanding and forgiveness. Which traits would you least wish to be described as having? i) Why would it be so terrible? In what ways are you similar to your parents or childhood caregivers? i) Is this a conscious decision? In what ways would you like to emulate them? ii) How do you actively choose (or try) to be different? What is your definition of failure? i) What makes these circumstances so terrible? ii) Imagine yourself in this situation. Write down five things you believe people would think about you. iii) Now write down five things you would hope people would think of you. Who regularly (or last) belittles or downplays your emotions? i) How does it make you feel? Think about unhealthy relationships you have currently or have had previously. What’s the common theme? i) Why do you think you find yourself in this kind of dynamic? ii) How can you recognise and avoid allowing this type of relationship to develop? What emotions tend to bring out the worst in you? i) Why do you think that is? When have you been self-sabotaging or destructive in your life? i) Examine how you were feeling at the time, and what triggered your behaviour. With whom or in which situations do you find yourself slipping on a mask or embodying a different persona? i) What do you think would happen if you exposed your true self? ii) How does that make you feel? Negative traits tend to develop in childhood as a defence mechanism. They’re useful at the time, but not as adults. List your least desirable traits. i) Where do they come from? i) Think about their purpose, and write about more positive and productive behaviours you could use instead. iii) Think about others you know who display these traits too, and how they make you feel. Make a promise to yourself to remember to look past the trait to the vulnerability behind it in future – we do not know other people’s stories. Think about your friendships. Which ones make you feel safe, secure, and loved? i) Do you have any in which you feel isolated, pressured, or otherwise uncomfortable? ii) Examine why this may be and if you have any negative history. How do you tend to respond to compliments? Make a concerted effort to learn to simply say ‘thank you’, if you don’t already do this. Which relationships in your life no longer serve you? Be ruthless – nobody else will see this. i) Which relationships feel obligatory or dutiful. Consider how you’d feel if you allowed those relationships to dissolve, then think about whether they’re worth trying to salvage, and how you may be able to do that. ii) Perhaps write a letter to that person/those people. What do you most dislike about yourself? i) Really examine why that is, and whether you’d feel the same level of distaste for somebody else in your position. List out your core values. i) Are you living in alignment with them? What could you change to be more in harmony with them? ii) Do they match those of your childhood caregivers? iii) If not, explore why this might be. What do you wish people understood about you? i) How might you be better able to demonstrate the quality that people tend to overlook? Do you have or have you had recurring nightmares? What’s the theme? What might it relate to? i) How might you face the fear causing your nightmare? What’s the worst way you’ve been taken advantage of in your lifetime? i) Think about the person who treated you that way, and consider their circumstances. What do you think drove them to it? ii) If you don’t know enough about them to answer this question, imagine what their story is. Write it down, keeping in mind that nobody is born evil. Terrible experiences do not excuse terrible behaviours unto others, but they can help you to forgive and make peace. Now imagine somebody else is working through the previous exercise and they are picturing you . i) Who is the person, and what did you do to them? ii) What were your circumstances at the time? Write a letter to the person explaining yourself and apologising. iii) Have you forgiven yourself? Imagine the person writing their letter to you, and then forgiving you. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale breathe out any feelings of guilt you’ve been holding onto. What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? i) What drove you to it? ii) Have you confessed to your misdemeanour? Are you afraid of being honest? iii) Examine why this is and whether it’s truly valid. iv) Are you protecting yourself or others? v) Could being open about it help to bring you peace? vi) How might you atone for it? What authority figures (individuals as opposed to institutions) did you respect growing up? i) What qualities did/do they possess? ii) Do you share those traits? How might you develop/enhance them? Without thinking too deeply, what’s your gut reaction to the question ‘Do people respect you’? i) Why do you think this is? ii) How do you feel about this? How are you letting yourself down at this time in your life? i) How could you be better to yourself? Consider your health, finances, relationships, work, etc. What lies have you previously told yourself? i) Are you being entirely truthful with yourself at this time in your life? When you are alone, what does you inner voice sound like? Is it positive or negative? i) Consider whose voice that truly is. ii) Write a letter to the person who became your inner voice, thanking them if they champion you, or challenging them if they are critical. What was your last uncharitable thought? Did you voice it? i) Was it deserved? ii) Were you being unfairly judgemental? Who do you owe an apology to? Make a list of everyone you can think of, even if it’s from a different time in your life. i) If anybody springs to mind, write them a letter. You don’t have to send it if it’s not appropriate to do so, but write it anyway. Who owes you an apology? i) Why? What did they do? Is it possible you misinterpreted the situation? ii) Write yourself a letter from their perspective, explaining the reasons for their transgression, and apologising. iii) Now take a deep breath, and as you exhale breathe out any resentment or hurt you’ve been holding onto. What’s your biggest regret in life? i) How might you be able to make peace with that? Think about your circumstances at the time and give yourself permission to be okay with the fact that you did your best at the time. What’s your worst childhood memory? i) Who was there? ii) How did they comfort you or make it worse? iii) What would you like to say to them? Perhaps write them an unsent letter. Do you have any other traumatic childhood memories? What situation in your life do you most wish had had a different outcome? i) How would it have improved your life? ii) In what ways is your life better for it not having worked out? Who do you feel inferior to? i) Objectively explore whether they have intentionally made you feel this way, or if it’s your own feelings of inadequacy creating that illusion. ii) How do you think they view you or feel about you? Why? Who has let you down the most in your life? i) Are they still around? How do you feel about that? What’s the worst character trait you have as a result of your childhood? i) What or who do you think caused it? ii) How do you feel about that? What are your parents’ best/worst attributes? i) How are you alike/unlike them? What is the worst emotion somebody could provoke in you? For example, anger, betrayal, jealousy. i) Why do you feel so strongly about this? ii) Does your answer differ according to the person in question? Think about a time you were manipulative. Explore the feeling behind the behaviour – what need made you behave that way? Have you overcome that feeling? How do you feel about your childhood? i) Was it generally positive or negative? ii) Who made you feel safe and who let you down? iii) Who were you close to? How does drama make you feel? i) Are you dramatic yourself? ii) Do people call you dramatic? How do you feel about this? Which of your traits do you find it difficult to accept? Explore why this is. i) Do you accept these traits in others? Do others readily accept these traits? ii) Think of somebody who shares this characteristic with you. Write down three things you admire about them. iii) This trait does not define you; write down three ways that you are more than this characteristic. Who do you hold a grudge against? i) What is stopping you from letting it go? Think about a time you felt betrayed. Have you made peace with the person involved? Write them a letter explaining how it made you feel, and forgiving them. Thinking about the previous exercise; now consider when you may have behaved similarly. Has the person involved treated you as though you betrayed them? Either way, write them a letter apologising. Who have you previously had conflict with and allegedly resolved it, but you remain wary of since? i) How did they make you feel? ii) What worries you about the relationship now? How do you view asking for help? i) Is it a sign of strength or weakness? Why is this? What makes you self-conscious around others? Who dislikes you or treats you poorly or with disrespect? i) How does it make you feel? ii) Where does this attitude or behaviour come from? iii) Being very honest, is it deserved? Do you owe this person an apology? iv) If you do, write them a letter apologising sincerely, or reach out in some other way. v) Write this sentence down ten times: Other people’s opinions of me are none of my business. What makes you feel unsafe? Explore this. What could have made your childhood better? How do you feel about that? What one thing could somebody say to you to bring you to your knees? i) Why do those words hold so much power? ii) How can you begin to take the power out of those words? Who have you most let down in your lifetime, and how/why did it happen? i) Have you made peace with the situation? ii) Write a letter to the person you disappointed telling them how you feel, even if you don’t send it. What does freedom mean to you? What in your life gives you the most purpose? Think about the people closest to you. What would you change about them, if you could, to improve your relationship (perhaps something to do with the way you resolve conflicts)? i) How does that reflect on you? ii) Based on this exercise, is there anything you could consider improving in yourself to help? What makes you feel most valued? What would you most like to be recognised for? Now available as a free printable in two great designs!

Some Background on Shadow Work… Shadow work is an intense form of inner work, based on Jung’s theory of the shadow. Read more about shadow work . Shadows tend to develop as a reaction to painful experiences from our past. The character traits we develop are primitive – and not attractive qualities and for this reason we repress or deny them. This allows them to live as shadows in our unconscious, where they tend to negatively influence our behaviours without our conscious knowledge or understanding. While the existence of our shadow parts makes sense in terms their capacity to offer self-preservation, in the wider context of our day to day lives, they do not serve us well. Spending time actively seeking out and illuminating our shadow can effectively remove its power. Shadows are often expressed via projection, and you may recognise elements of yours by observing specific people or situations which trigger strong or unpleasant feelings in you. Left unchecked our shadows can lead to self-sabotaging behaviours such as: Jealousy Resentment Bitterness Anger and aggression Addiction Guilt and shame However, spending time actively seeking out and illuminating our shadow can effectively remove its power. You can achieve this through shadow work exercises , with shadow work journaling being one of the best options.

And, crucially, to consider what you learn from a non-judgemental perspective. We can’t control others, we can only control ourselves, and this is the foundation of shadow work: Awareness and acceptance of our faults and limitations, forgiving ourselves and others, and letting go of the pain we’re holding onto in order to live a more peaceful life. 680 shares By Author Kate Tunstall Posted on Last updated: December 3, 2021 Categories Journaling , Personal Growth Home » Personal Growth » 75 Shadow Work Journal Prompts to Help You Realise Your True Potential Tags Journal Prompts Shadow Work Post navigation The Positive Way to Stop Your Child From Sulking 113 Self Loving Affirmations + 33 Quotes About Self Worth to Boost Your Self-Esteem Click here to cancel reply.

            "21 Journal Prompts: When you Need Healing From What Hurts – Grit & Virtue Start Here Coaching Who We Are Magazine The Manifesto Shop Search 4 min read 21 Journal Prompts: When you Need Healing From What Hurts Tracie Braylock 4 min read 21 Journal Prompts: When you Need Healing From What Hurts Tracie Braylock A practice that requires few resources or expertise, journaling offers you the space to reflect, reveal and release whatever you’re harboring, and heal whatever is hurting. Holding onto pain can lead to bitterness, resentment, anxiety, fatigue, chronic illness, debilitating diseases and feelings of discontent and disconnection. Holding onto pain can lead to bitterness, resentment, anxiety, fatigue, chronic illness, debilitating diseases and feelings of discontent and disconnection. Click to tweet As a holistic nurse, I’ve witnessed those who’ve experienced traumatic events and were left speechless. And others, in an effort to keep everything in them from falling apart, simply refuse to allow words to depart from their lips. In these moments of heartache and despair, being handed a pen often feels safer and doable, giving you a simple tool to begin clearing your mind and mending your wounds. As both an art form and healing practice, journaling effectively offers you the space to reflect upon and capture life’s memorable moments and let go of painful experiences and broken identities. Because let’s face it, as modern women, we must do the often challenging work of surrendering our pain instead of suppressing or suffering from it, expressing and exercising our faith to create space to be fully healed. We must do the often challenging work of surrendering our pain instead of suppressing or suffering from it, expressing and exercising our faith to create space to be fully healed. Click to tweet A practice that only requires you to be honest and vulnerable with yourself, journaling can help you work towards the root cause of what you’re experiencing and why, breaking open the pathway to your healing and transformation to take place. Some of the immediate therapeutic benefits of journaling include: Alleviating stress Improving immune function Boosting spiritual connection Lowering blood pressure Enhancing mental focus Healing faster and more thoroughly So simply begin to write. Journal what currently is, and the vision for the healing you desire to take place. From this space of honesty with self and God , continue to release your heart’s desires, resting in the wholeness and healing your relationship with Him has made available to you. Here are journaling prompts to help you deepen your healing: Personal Do you think you’ve failed yourself in one way or another? How can you begin to forgive yourself? What secrets are you holding onto and what harm are they causing? Are you willing to uncover the sources of your pain? Why or why not? Do you examine mistakes that you’ve made from a place of compassion or judgment? What do you need to forgive your younger self for not knowing? What do you need to know how to do, or learn more about? How is not knowing/learning holding you back? What anger or frustrations are you holding onto and why? Relationships Who do you need to forgive and why? What experiences have you had with others that you believe you’re still suffering from? Who have you hurt and why? How can you mend the harm that you’ve caused others to experience? Are you upset with God about something that has taken place in your life? Why? Who do you want to help you in your life? What’s stopping you from cultivating this relationship? What are some things that you like about yourself that others seem to criticize you about? Situational What situations are taking place in your community, country or the world that leave you hurting or confused? How can you contribute to the healing and suffering you see in a positive manner? What do you need to let go of that you have no control over? What fears arise from external conditions that are out of your control? Which external circumstances cause you to experience the most stress? How can you use your hurt and pain to change situations and/or help someone else? Whether the wounds that need your attention are deep or superficial, journaling is a balm, helping you soothe and sort through what’s present, and position you for the future. May you allow the Lord to use the gift of journaling to break what has you bound. To mend what’s currently broken. To breathe life into dying situations. And to bring love, light and joy into dark and discouraging situations. Enjoyed it? Share it!

            "8 Journal Prompts on how to heal your Inner Child NIKITA VYAS Counselling Psychologist, Life and Mindset coach Home Services Blog Shop Contact More Use tab to navigate through the menu items. 0 Nikita Vyas Apr 10, 2020 4 min read 8 Journal Prompts on how to heal your Inner Child Have you ever felt that sometimes when you’re at your extreme low you tend to refer instances from your childhood or experiences from your past that you’ve had to deal with as a child? Do you find yourself complaining not from a place of an adult but like a child would? Have you ever felt weirded out after an outburst or an emotional release and wondered where did all the resentment and grief come from? I recently had such an outburst and felt as afraid as though searching for faith and trust. I suddenly felt like a 13-year-old, crying, feeling lost. It took me back to the time my father passed away and my life had changed in one day. Nothing was the same and it felt as if the 13-year-old in me was still trying to process it all. It was unpleasant to say the least and even then I couldn’t stop myself from saying and feeling the way I was feeling. With all the Psychological jargons thrown in the air I’m sure you must’ve come across the term or concept of - “Inner Child”. Yup! That. It’s not complicated and obviously doesn’t mean – to have a child in you (unless, of course you’re pregnant) To put it simply, the Inner-child is about the child within you that is a part of your personality. Most of us are in touch with our inner-child, mostly subconsciously. Most people realize about their inner-child after they experience a trauma or a life changing event. Even though most people have a healthy childhood it’s possible for their inner-child to undergo something that changes the way they feel and think about them as a person, especially as an adult. As a 30 year old adult today it can be really messed up to still feel so hung up about all those feelings and I couldn’t realize and make out as to what was really going on so I did what I thought would help, I started journaling and decided to open a Tarot Spread. Q 1 – What is your Inner child feeling currently? Q 2 – As a child what did you always lack or were deprived of? Q 3 – What is your Inner child afraid of? Q 4 – In what way is this affecting your life right now? Q 5 – How can you provide love and care to your inner-child? Q 6 – If you had to say something to your inner child right now what would you say? Q 7 – In what way can you support your Inner child right now? Q 8 – A quality you had as a child that you’re fond of and wish you still had it in you? Since I create my own Tarot spreads from my journal prompts, I went ahead and created a spread from these prompts. Even though my business and career focus on Personal Development, which means I ‘should’ know more, I’ve come to realize there are still certain areas and situations in my life that reveal so much more than what I’ve encountered and learned about me. In these past 2 years I’ve learned to slowly embrace the fun lighter side of me, without judging too much simply because from time to time I do listen to what my inner child needs. Especially when I feel stuck creatively, emotionally and mentally. Which is why when the answers in my spread spoke so much about that one defining moment, I knew this outburst was about me as a child when I was 13 and the emotions and feelings I experienced then. It’s difficult to articulate with precision as to how it works for everyone since we all have a plethora of emotions and feelings, the way we react to the same situation also differs from one another. When working with a client either through Life Coaching I often see them come face to face with the cause of their limitations deep rooted within the pent-up feelings and emotions of their Inner-child. A part of them that’s always needed either love, validation, approval or has struggled with fear, anxiety etc, that tends to interfere with they way they feel about them as adults now, personally as well as professionally. Resulting in their self-doubt, anxiety, procrastination, pain and guilt, their need to be perfect, body shaming and so much more. It takes a lot of courage to accept and process these feelings and emotions. It takes a lot of courage to talk to the inner-child in you who’s so scared, afraid and lost that you just want to hug her and not let go. All the while trying to convince her that everything’s going to be okay – now as an adult. People react differently toward their experiences and feelings about their inner-child. And the best thing to do is to give your inner-child the attention it really needs even today and try to provide the comfort she’s looking for. Kindness, Compassion and Empathy are key elements in this along with unconditional and infinite support. Journal Prompt How to heal your Inner Child - Journal P .

Make the time to reflect this month and enjoy this exploration of your experiences and dreams. Download the FREE 30 Day Journal Challenge PDF and track your progress. Benefits of journal writing There are many benefits to journal writing. The most important is having the space to organize your thoughts. Being able to record your emotions, ideas and the memory connected to each day allows us to make space in our minds. This practice can be impactful to understanding the pattern of our daily routine. As we all know, the world can move too fast to keep up with. Journaling is an effective way to carve a healthy corner for reflection. It is a way the heart searches for a voice. How to write a journal entry Everyone has a different journaling style. Use this opportunity to embrace your individuality and the unique way you show up in the world. There is no right or wrong way to journal, just a unique one. Some people are critical and neat while others are playful and stylish. It is more important to begin the work than to get stuck on planning. The most effective form of expression is execution. As you embark on this journey, you will discover which ‘style’ is best suitable for your thoughts. Start where you are, as you are. 30 Day Journal Challenge We are in constant communication with the universe. With planning we have the ability to create the future that we want. Through experience, reason and emotions, we become empowered to transform our reality. This 30-Day Journaling challenge will help you tap into that power to bring your desires to life. Set an Intention (Day 1) You may have heard the phrase, ‘direction is more important than speed.’ It is important to set an intention before you embark on this challenge because you can go fast headed the wrong way. To avoid any misdirection, envision the frame of mind you want to adapt. Then connect your actions to embody those traits. Being intentional vitalizes authenticity. Keep showing up. Day 1 Prompt: List at least three things that make you feel grounded. How do you want those things to carry you today? How do they make you feel more connected to yourself and others? Practice Gratitude (Day 2 - 8) The practice of gratitude is necessary for connecting the mind to the present. This expression provides a unique opportunity to enhance appreciation for what we have, what the world offers and ultimately who we are. Through gratitude we minimize the clutter in our minds and the need for comparison, as well as emotions that trigger resentment or envy. It is important to begin here with gratitude, to ground our focus on the goal of self-improvement. It is a bridge to intimacy and a stronger relationship with self. Gratitude journal prompts What person in your life are you most grateful for? What do you admire about them? Take a moment. Write about the last memory that made you happy. What does it feel like in your body? Focus on that feeling today. What is something you have now that seemed like a wish back then? How do you feel knowing that you have it now? Name a few people who keep you grounded. In what ways do they show up for you? Name a skill you’re good at. How do you feel when you are performing that skill? What brings you joy? List three things you appreciate about your body and how it supports you. Learn to Love Yourself (Day 9 - 15) Self love is a gentle commitment to oneself. A graceful act of devotion to growth and embracing who you are. It is a key to true happiness and emotional strength. Gratitude gives you the power to navigate through this journey. Self love is a compass that will bring you back to yourself. Self love journal prompts Write about a time you enjoyed your own company. Name something you often expect to receive from others. In what ways can you give it to yourself? What do you love about most yourself? Describe it in detail. Where do you feel most blocked? What small thing can you do today to release that? Do you feel loved? If you loved yourself more, how would the world see you? What changes can you implement more frequently to show yourself love? Write an encouraging letter to your younger self. Give Yourself Grace (Day 16 - 22) Through healing we acquire the necessary strength to recover from old wounds. Though every journey is different, healing is a walk of patience. It is a process you endure through humility, self love and compassion. You have to trust that your effort has been planted and will grow with time; and that it is good enough. Healing requires grace for the mind to transform. Journal prompts for healing Revisit a time you felt the most disconnected in your life. What happened? How did it impact your thoughts? What lessons did you learn from it? What do you need to forgive yourself for? Write the first step towards letting go. How do you show up for yourself during hard times? Where and when do you feel the most safe? How can you create more of that feeling? What makes me guarded? What do you need in order to trust again? What moment did you realize that you healed from something that once hurt you? What are you still holding on to that no longer serves you? Transform and Grow (Day 23 - 29) Journaling is a powerful tool to declutter the mind from life’s tempo. Through this practice, transformation becomes possible. When you put pen to paper, you give your mind the permission to feel your transformation. This is important for accountability and activates the belief that you are worthy. Journal prompts for transformation Describe the highest version of you. What separates you from becoming one with that version of yourself? How do you connect to your intuition? How does it speak to you? Complete the sentence ‘I am afraid that..’ Then answer, who would you be if you were not fearful? Define what success means to you. What have you succeeded at and how can you apply that formula to other areas of your life? What are some things that you have outgrown? How does it make you feel? What can I control right now? Visualize the ideal life you want, what stands out the most. Why? Find the Good Things that Happened (Day 30) As this challenge comes to a close, I want you to reflect on the small ways you have regained control. It is an essential need for transformation because true power is internal. Transformation requires intentional observation. It asks for us to slow down our thinking to create space for new thinking. Journaling gives us an opportunity to organize our thoughts to reflect our experiences. Through practice and commitment, it can also reshape the pace of our world. When we reflect, we connect deeper to the world around us. Day 30 Prompt: In what ways has your mindset shifted from scarcity to abundance? Write about the small changes you notice in your daily routine that has affected you in a positive way. Are you ready to transform?

            "10 Journaling Prompts for Releasing Emotions | by Skylar Rae | Medium Get started Open in app Skylar Rae Sign in Get started 48 Followers About Get started Open in app 10 Journaling Prompts for Releasing Emotions Skylar Rae Mar 1, 2021 · 2 min read Do you ever feel like you have no idea how you are feeling or exactly why you are feeling a certain way? Or you can’t seem to explain how you are feeling to others? Well, journaling can be a very powerful tool to help you work and sort through overwhelming emotions. It can also help you to uncover the reasons behind certain emotions and help you to become more comfortable being vulnerable with yourself. Journaling is a process of self-reflection and uncovering your inner truth. It can be extremely cathartic as your emotions and thoughts are no longer stuck in your head. Rather they have been shared with the pages of your journal. You no longer have to carry the burden all by yourself. Additionally, journaling can be a form of tapping into your higher self so you can uncover the lessons behind your experiences. If you are unfamiliar with journaling, it can be difficult to know where to start. Especially if getting in touch with your emotions is a foreign experience to you. Therefore, starting with some journaling prompts can be very helpful to get you started. If you are an experienced journaler, discovering new journaling prompts can also be very helpful because they can expand your journaling abilities. There is always something new to learn when you bring a pen to paper, even if you have done it a thousand times. Therefore, here are 10 journal prompts for releasing emotions that can either help you get started journaling or increase your journaling abilities: Write about all the things you are feeling at this moment, good, bad, and in between. Write about the last thing that made you cry, made you smile, made you laugh, and made you yell. What do you need right now? If you have something you want to say to someone but can’t, write it in a letter addressed to that person. Write how you are feeling as if you were telling your older self. Why are you feeling ______ (whichever emotion you are experiencing)? Write about a significant moment in your life and how it made you feel. What perspective do you have on life? Does it influence your emotions at the moment? Write a detailed description of the sensations you are feeling in your body and then if you can, connect it to your emotions. Describe all your emotions with no filters, journals don’t place judgment. I hope this helps relieve some emotional pressure. If it doesn’t work the first time be patient with yourself and try again. However, journaling does not work for everyone so if you try journaling and it doesn’t feel good, try a different method of emotional release. Happy journaling!

Personality questions to learn about someone else Guide Overview Learning about others People are social creatures, and we strive to understand one another in many ways. We observe each other, we learn by talking, and we build bonds . It's important to know a bit about the people you encounter daily to build empathy and treat each person respectfully. Whether on an interview or in your personal life, we question others to gauge their behavior, anticipate their reactions, and form an understanding of their worldview and values. Let's look at what personality questions are and examine a list of good personality questions you can refer to when trying to learn about others. What are personality questions? Personality questions are questions an interviewer or another person asks to gain understanding and insight into your character, values, principles, passions, work ethic, and ability to self-regulate and reflect. Your answers help them anticipate your behavioral outcomes in future situations and gauge whether your personality and character traits match theirs and their needs. Personality questions can help you get to know others and build a common understanding. Although you can ask any number of questions to understand a person better, most personality questions fall under the following categories: Statement-based personality questions: These questions provide an assertion, such as “I am well-organized” and the person responding uses a scale (typically one to five) as a response. This format is helpful for data collection but falls short when getting to know individuals and gaining specific insights. Closed-ended personality questions: These are typically multiple-choice style questions. Open-ended personality questions: These are often the most informative because they require a uniquely planned response with elaboration. Personality questions to learn about someone else Use the following list of open-ended personality questions to learn more about others and reveal their true personality and qualities. What has been your greatest accomplishment? What has been your greatest failure? Who knows you best, and why? How would your best friend describe you? How would your enemy describe you?

Ackerman, MA. 65 07-12-2021 Have you ever thought about your own thoughts or questioned your mental processes? Do you sometimes take time to clarify your values in a moment of doubt or uncertainty? If you answered “yes,” you are no stranger to self-reflection and introspection (terms that will be used more or less interchangeably in this article), an important psychological exercise that can help you grow, develop your mind, and extract value from your mistakes. Read on if you’d like to learn the meaning of self-reflection and introspection, reasons why it’s important, and tools and techniques for practicing it yourself. Before you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Self-Compassion Exercises for free . These detailed, science-based exercises will not only help you increase the compassion and kindness you show yourself but will also give you the tools to help your clients, students, or employees show more compassion to themselves. This article contains: What Is Introspection? A Definition What Is the Importance of Introspection? 70 Self-Reflective Questions to Ask Yourself 10 Self-Reflection Exercises, Activities, and Techniques for Adults and Students 4 Self-Reflection Worksheets and Tools The 3 Best Books on Self-Reflection and Introspection A Take-Home Message References What Is Introspection? A Definition Introspection can be practiced both as an informal reflection process and a formal experimental approach, and the two have different definitions. Still, both processes can be undertaken by anyone with curiosity and determination (Cherry, 2016). The informal reflection process can be defined as examining one’s own internal thoughts and feelings and reflecting on what they mean. The process can be focused on either one’s current mental experience or mental experiences from the very recent past. The formal experimental technique is a more objective and standardized version of this, in which people train themselves to carefully analyze the contents of their own thoughts in a way that’s as unbiased as possible. The original idea of introspection was developed by Wilhelm Wundt in the late 1800s (McLeod, 2008). Wundt focused on three areas of mental functioning: thoughts, images, and feelings. Wundt’s work eventually led to the current work on perceptual processes and the establishment of the field of cognitive psychology . What Is the Importance of Introspection? So, why is introspection important? Researchers have shown that we think more than 50,000 thoughts per day, of which more than half are negative and more than 90% are just repeats from the day before (Wood, 2013). If you don’t make the time and effort to refocus your mind on the positive through introspection, you won’t give yourself the opportunity to grow and develop. Enhancing our ability to understand ourselves and our motivations and to learn more about our own values helps us take the power away from the distractions of our modern, fast-paced lives and instead refocus on fulfillment (Wood, 2013). The importance of doing it right Reflecting on ourselves and our environments is a healthy and adaptive practice, but it should be undertaken with some care—there is, in fact, a wrong way to do it. When your focus on introspection has morphed from a dedication to an obsession, you have taken it too far. In fact, those who take self-reflection too far can end up feeling more stressed, depressed, and anxious than ever (Eurich, 2017). In addition, it is all too easy for us to fool ourselves into thinking we have found some deep insight that may or may not be accurate. We are surprisingly good at coming up with rational explanations for the irrational behaviors we engage in (Dahl, 2017). To help stay on the right path with your self-reflection, consider asking more “what” questions than “why” questions. “Why” questions can highlight our limitations and stir up negative emotions, while “what” questions help keep us curious and positive about the future (Eurich, 2017). With this important point in mind, let’s move on to the questions, exercises, and worksheets that you can use to work on your own self-reflection. 70 Self-Reflective Questions to Ask Yourself There are nearly endless questions, prompts, and ideas you can use to take a self-reflection break. Some of these can be asked, answered, and addressed every day, while others may best be saved for occasional self-reflection. Read through the following three lists to get some ideas for introspective questions. Answering them can take you from feeling like you don’t understand yourself to knowing yourself like the back of your hand. These 10 questions are great ways to jumpstart self-reflection (Woronko, n.d.): Am I using my time wisely? Am I taking anything for granted? Am I employing a healthy perspective? Am I living true to myself? Am I waking up in the morning ready to take on the day? Am I thinking negative thoughts before I fall asleep? Am I putting enough effort into my relationships? Am I taking care of myself physically? Am I letting matters that are out of my control stress me out? Am I achieving the goals that I’ve set for myself? The following 30 questions are questions you can ask yourself every day to get to know yourself better (William, n.d.): Who am I, really? What worries me most about the future? If this were the last day of my life, would I have the same plans for today? What am I really scared of? Am I holding on to something I need to let go of? If not now, then when? What matters most in my life? What am I doing about the things that matter most in my life? Why do I matter? Have I done anything lately that’s worth remembering? Have I made someone smile today? What have I given up on? When did I last push the boundaries of my comfort zone? If I had to instill one piece of advice in a newborn baby, what advice would I give? What small act of kindness was I once shown that I will never forget? How will I live, knowing I will die? What do I need to change about myself? Is it more important to love or be loved? How many of my friends would I trust with my life? Who has had the greatest impact on my life? Would I break the law to save a loved one? Would I steal to feed a starving child? What do I want most in life? What is life asking of me? Which is worse: failing or never trying? If I try to fail and succeed, what have I done? What’s the one thing I’d like others to remember about me at the end of my life? Does it really matter what others think about me? To what degree have I actually controlled the course of my life? When all is said and done, what will I have said more than I’ve done? Finally, the following 30 prompts and questions are great ways to put your journal to use (Tartakovsky, 2014): My favorite way to spend the day is . . . If I could talk to my teenage self, the one thing I would say is . . . The two moments I’ll never forget in my life are . . . (Describe them in great detail, and what makes them so unforgettable.) Make a list of 30 things that make you smile. “Write about a moment experienced through your body. Making love, making breakfast, going to a party, having a fight, an experience you’ve had or you imagine for your character. Leave out thought and emotion, and let all information be conveyed through the body and senses.” The words I’d like to live by are . . . I couldn’t imagine living without . . . When I’m in pain—physical or emotional—the kindest thing I can do for myself is . . . Make a list of the people in your life who genuinely support you, and whom you can genuinely trust. Then, make time to hang out with them. What does unconditional love look like for you? What things would you do if you loved yourself unconditionally? How can you act on these things, even if you’re not yet able to love yourself unconditionally? I really wish others knew this about me . . . Name what is enough for you. If my body could talk, it would say . . . Name a compassionate way you’ve supported a friend recently. Then, write down how you can do the same for yourself. What do you love about life? What always brings tears to your eyes? (As Paulo Coelho has said, “Tears are words that need to be written.”) Write about a time when your work felt real, necessary and satisfying to you, whether the work was paid or unpaid, professional or domestic, physical or mental. Write about your first love—whether it’s a person, place or thing. Using 10 words, describe yourself. What’s surprised you the most about your life or life in general? What can you learn from your biggest mistakes? I feel most energized when . . . “Write a list of questions to which you urgently need answers.” Make a list of everything that inspires you—whether books, websites, quotes, people, paintings, stores, or stars in the sky. What’s one topic you need to learn more about to help you live a more fulfilling life? (Then, follow through and learn more about that topic.) I feel happiest in my skin when . . . Make a list of everything you’d like to say no to. Make a list of everything you’d like to say yes to. Write the words you need to hear. 10 Self-Reflection Exercises, Activities, and Techniques for Adults and Students Aside from the questions and prompts listed above, there are many exercises and activities that can open you up to valuable self-reflection. For example, the five self-examination exercises listed below (Bates, 2012) are a good way to get started with self-reflection. They’re simple and easy to do, but they can familiarize you with the process for more in-depth reflection in the future. Self-Examination Exercise 1 Consider whether or not you tend to analyze people or diagnose their problems for them without their encouragement or request. Often when we hold information that has helped us to make sense of the world, we want to share it. This information, when unprompted and delivered to another person, sometimes doesn’t feel so good. They may feel like you are telling them that something about them is wrong, something that they might not necessarily agree with. Remind yourself that this information needs to be asked for and not prescribed by you, no matter how valid it feels to pass it on (Bates, 2012). Self-Examination Exercise 2 This is a good exercise if you tend to expend a lot of energy trying to understand what upsets you about another person’s actions. You may also spend a lot of energy thinking of ways to address that person about what upsets you. Not only does this burn a lot of your energy, but it also can have an unintended effect on the person who has upset you. When you place a clear emphasis or focus on what is wrong when speaking with someone, it implies that you are dissatisfied and unhappy. Usually, the issue you have is not something that is making you terribly unhappy, just an annoyance or irritation, so this doom and gloom is not the message you want to deliver. It’s just a single issue that needs attention, but it can seem much bigger and more pervasive to the person you are planning to discuss it with. Try to remind yourself that this problem, no matter how valid an issue it is or how important it is to you, is not the whole of your feelings. When you deliver this information, remember that a person who loves you does not want to be the cause of your unhappiness—do not make them feel an unnecessary amount of pain as a result of the unhappiness they’ve caused you. Keep your focus on the big picture when you bring up issues, or you risk turning a small issue into a much broader problem (Bates, 2012). Self-Examination Exercise 3 Do you frequently interrupt people or constantly think of your own stories to share while they are talking? If you’re like a lot of social people, the answer is probably yes. In order to relate to others, we have to share a little bit of ourselves with them—your stories can help you establish common ground with others or make you closer with them. However, if you’re only focused on sharing your stories, it can distract you from the greater purpose of a conversation. In our eagerness to relate, please, entertain, and share, we often remove ourselves from the present, reducing our ability to be sensitive and engaged listeners. Even if we spend our whole lives trying to be good listeners , sometimes we slip out of practice in empathizing or identifying with the person we’re talking to, or we lose an opportunity to comfort or entertain the other person. Next time you have a conversation with a loved one and you find yourself thinking ahead of them, take a moment to pause and truly listen. Don’t think about how you can personally identify with what they are talking about, and don’t search your memory bank for a relevant story of your own—just listen. It’s a rewarding experience to truly soak in what another person is saying, both for you and the other person (Bates, 2012). Self-Examination Exercise 4 Sometimes when we work very hard to do good things, we get to a level of comfort with that fact, and we begin to talk about it to others. That can be a great thing in that it allows us to own our efforts and our actions and, with that, acknowledge our goodness to ourselves. But for this exercise, consider how you might feel if you were to do things that are good, but only for your own knowledge. The next time you do something really wonderful, try keeping that wonderful thing to yourself and not sharing it with anyone. Often when a person is good and loving, they don’t have to tell anyone; it’s a truth that shines from every angle of their person. As an experiment, keep some knowledge to yourself, as a gift to you (Bates, 2012). Self-Examination Exercise 5 For this exercise, you need only to do one thing: Consider what you don’t know. When we get to a place of comfort in our skin and in the world, we tend to lose the ability to see things from a different perspective. Things make sense to us in our own point of view, so what’s left to know? Everything, it turns out. By this, we mean to try and remind yourself of these facts: You cannot know or understand everything, and you are not the judge of what is right for another person. You can neither read minds nor know what the future holds. You can only exist in one moment at a time, and you are changing every day. Trust that sometimes others know themselves and their lives better than you ever could. Listen with the awareness that you might learn something new. Be open to the fact that you might one day feel totally different about something that you believe to be fixed—and that includes your sticking points, the “unchangeables” you thought were forever set in stone. Let what you don’t know and can’t know be a comfort rather than something to fear, because it means that anything is possible (Bates, 2012). Once you have found your footing with these self-examination exercises, the following introspective exercises are a great next step. Affirmations Creating affirmations is a helpful way to clear your mind and put things in perspective. Affirmations can be defined as positive phrases or statements used to challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts . For this exercise, write a list of at least 50 affirmations. They should address what you want to embrace, improve, and achieve in your life. Follow these instructions when composing and practicing your affirmations: Write the affirmations in the present tense and be sure to use the word “I” throughout the affirmations; Focus on the things that are occurring now that will lead to your future success. You may have negative thoughts pop up, but do your best to let go of the negative thoughts and replace them with positive thinking; Repeat your affirmations aloud to help reprogram your mind with more positive thoughts. Following these steps can help you open yourself up to the positive in your life and take steps that will lead you to the future you want (Holothink, n.d.). Subconscious Mind Exercise In this exercise, you will dive into your subconscious. Don’t worry, it’s not as painful or scary as it sounds! Your subconscious mind is where your self-image is stored. All of your attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values are stored deep in your subconscious, driving your behavior and forming the core of who you are. We don’t often take time to think about ourselves on this level. So in this exercise, take some time and put a concerted effort into thinking about your attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values. It may take a few sessions of self-reflection to really uncover your core beliefs, but it’s worth the effort it takes to learn about yourself. Reflecting on this core component of yourself will help you gain greater self-awareness . Much like meditation, it will help you achieve a new, higher level of consciousness, and it may just help you find valuable information and answers about yourself and your beliefs (Holothink, n.d.). Visualization Exercise This exercise offers you an opportunity to put your creativity to use. Create a box, a vision board, or some other medium to store and display who you are and what your hopes and dreams are for the future. You can create or decorate your box or board however you’d like. Use whatever you feel represents yourself and what’s important to you. Place pictures, words, drawings, poems, or small items of personal significance on your board or in your box. The more details you include, the better. The end result is a visual representation of yourself and what you love. Come back to the box or board when you’re having a dilemma or trying to figure out the best course of action, and draw from this visual representation of yourself to help you make decisions (Holothink, n.d.). For this exercise, feel free to put your imagination to good use—the sky’s the limit when it comes to visualization. Questions About Yourself This exercise is simple, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. All you need to do is ask yourself some questions. Ask yourself questions about yourself. Write down the questions, then write down your answers to the questions. Ask yourself about your past, present, and future, and compose answers to the questions that are positive, insightful, and motivating to you. Don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answers—there aren’t any right answers, and your answers will likely change over time. And be as creative as you’d like with the questions and answers since no one else needs to answer or read them but you. Be sure to structure your questions to include details about your hopes and dreams. The more detailed your questions and answers, the more opportunity you have to dig into some valuable self-reflection (Holothink, n.d.). Write and Reflect Journaling is great for many reasons, and it can be used in several applications for introspection. For this exercise, get a journal, diary, or notebook with plenty of pages to write in. Every day, write down three things in your journal: At least one positive thing that happened to or around you today; A question for yourself (you can use one of the questions from the previous exercise, a question from the lists we covered earlier, or something entirely new), but don’t answer it yet; A reflection on the question you wrote the previous day for yourself and an answer to it. Following these steps, you will write only the first two components on the first day but will write three components every day thereafter (Holothink, n.d.). 4 Self-Reflection Worksheets and Tools In addition to the questions, prompts, writing ideas , and exercises included above, here are some worksheets and tools that can help get you started with introspection. Self-Awareness Worksheet This worksheet is a treasure trove of exercises and ideas to help you think about yourself, including your talents, qualities, values, and perceptions. The point of this worksheet is to help you know and understand: Your beliefs and principles; What you value and what is important to you; What motivates you; Your own emotions ; Your thinking patterns; Your tendencies to react to certain situations; What you want out of life. There are several sections to this worksheet, each of which has its own set of questions and prompts: – Talents What are your greatest talents or skills? Which of your talents or skills gives you the greatest sense of pride or satisfaction? – Traits/Qualities What are your five greatest strengths? What do you feel are your two biggest weaknesses? What qualities or traits do you most admire in others? – Values What are ten things that are really important to you? What are the three most important things to you? What are the values that you hold nearest to your heart? – Perception How is the “public you” different from the “private you”? What do you want people to think and say about you? Is it more important to be liked by others or to be yourself? Why? – Accomplishments What three things are you most proud of in your life to date? What do you hope to achieve in life? If you could accomplish only one thing before you died, what would it be? – Reflection What is something that represents you (e.g., song, animal, flower, poem, symbol, jewelry, etc.)? Why? What three things would you like to change most about yourself? List three things that you are. – Finish the Sentence In the final section, you will be shown several prompts to complete: I do my best when . . . I struggle when . . . I am comfortable when . . . I feel stress when . . . I am courageous when . . . One of the most important things I learned was . . . I missed a great opportunity when . . . One of my favorite memories is . . . My toughest decisions involve . . . Being myself is hard because . . . I can be myself when . . . I wish I were more . . . I wish I could . . . I wish I would regularly . . . I wish I had . . . I wish I knew . . . I wish I felt . . . I wish I saw . . . I wish I thought . . . Life should be about . . . I am going to make my life about . . . Once you finish this worksheet, you should have plenty of insight into who you really are and what is most important to you. Use your answers to inform your decisions about what goals you choose to strive toward, what you would like to do in the future, and what moves to make next. You can view, download, or print this worksheet for yourself. Tool 1: Persona Before moving on to the empathy map below, first create a “persona,” or a clear character representation of your actual self, your ideal self, and your “ought” self (Kos, n.d.). In order to create this persona, you will need to thoroughly analyze who you are, who you want to become, and what the social expectations connected to your feelings and behaviors are like in different situations. Answering questions like the following can help you define these three important selves: Why do I want to become [enter a characteristic important to you] ? Who in my life was or is like that? Who would I be proud if I were [enter a characteristic important to you] ? Why? How are my feelings in certain situations connected with my actual, ideal, and ought self? Am I pushing myself to be something I’m actually not? Am I being something I’m not just because others expect it of me? Use your answers to these questions to help you get an idea of who you are, who you want to be, and who you feel you ought to be. Once this preparation has been completed, move on to creating an empathy map. Tool 2: Empathy Map An empathy map can help you engage in a valuable and informative process of self-reflection, using all of your senses to help you identify your needs and the disconnections between what you say and what you do (Kos, n.d.). Don’t worry—we all have a disconnect between what we say and what we do. This exercise can help you figure out where you have these disconnects and how you can best address them to become the person you want to be. To create your empathy map, simply draw four quadrants on a piece of paper. Each quadrant represents a different aspect of yourself: Seeing; Doing; Thinking; Feeling. Next, consider a situation that evokes a specific strong emotion in you, like having a fight with your spouse or significant other. In each quadrant, write down the relevant aspects of each perspective. For example, for the fight scenario, you could write down something like the following: Seeing: What are some of the things you saw during the situation? Doing: What actions did you do and which behaviors did you notice in yourself? What is the behavioral pattern you can identify? Thinking: What were you thinking in that situation? What does this tell you about your beliefs? Feeling: What emotions were you feeling? Why? Which past situation do they most remind you of? On the backside of your piece of paper, on another piece of paper, or next to your four quadrants, create a fifth section. Here, you will write down your insights and ideas based on your empathy map. The following questions can help you with the self-reflection process while you’re working on your map: How is the situation connected to your fears and hopes? What are your fears? What are your hopes? Which of your needs are met or not met in that situation? What was the environment in which you encountered the situation? What do you remember from the environment? How did you find yourself in that environment and why? What was your sight focused on? What hurts you most in the situation or makes you feel good about the situation? What was the feedback you gathered from your environment or other people? What are all the positives about the situation? What can you learn about yourself, others, and the world by experiencing that kind of a situation? Do your best to avoid falling prey to cognitive distortions or reinforcing negative feelings while answering these questions. Go deep, and identify why you feel like you do. Observe, but don’t judge (Kos, n.d.). Tool 3: Life Satisfaction Chart A life satisfaction chart is a great way to assess how well you are meeting your goals and furthering your hopes for the future. You can complete this chart periodically to track your progress toward your goals and see what needs to be revised, improved, reduced, or eliminated to help you strive toward them. Draw a scale from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied) horizontally, and list the following ten areas of life vertically: You; Health; Relationships; Money; Career; Emotions; Competencies; Fun; Spirituality ; Technology. Assess your satisfaction in each of the 10 areas using the scale you created. Next, take a second look at all the areas where you are only somewhat satisfied (where you used a rating between 4 and 7). It can be hard to effectively reflect when you don’t have a clear idea of whether you are satisfied with a specific area or not. Go back through these “somewhat satisfied” areas and rate your satisfaction again, but use only ratings between 1 and 3 or 8 and 10. Limiting your options to either “very satisfied” or “not very satisfied” will help you to make a more decisive judgment about your satisfaction in each area. Highlight every section rated with a 1, 2, or 3 with red, and highlight every section rated with an 8, 9, or 10 with green. Finally, for all ten areas of life, ask yourself, Why did you rate each area how you did? What would make you change your rating? Repeat this exercise as often as you’d like to help you keep track of your satisfaction with the way your life is going (Kos, n.d.). The 3 Best Books on Self-Reflection and Introspection There are many books out there on self-reflection, self-awareness , and introspection, but we recommend the books below as resources to help you start your journey. 1. Question Your Life: Naikan Self-Reflection and the Transformation of Our Stories – Gregg Krech This book will introduce the reader to Naikan , a method of quiet self-reflection that originated in Japan. Like the physical bags we carry when we go on a journey, our hearts and our minds only have so much room—but instead of carrying luggage, they carry stories. Some stories inform our lives and help us understand ourselves, while others don’t serve a purpose and can weigh us down. In this book, Krech will guide the reader through several powerful examples of people who had an important change of heart or mind as a result of quiet self-reflection, including a woman who hated her mother, a man estranged from his father, a pregnant woman hit by a train, a couple who was struggling with their marriage, and a rabbi who neglected his shoes. Read this book to open yourself up to seeing the world differently, and finding a better path forward. You can find it on Amazon . 2. Being Present: A Book of Daily Reflections – David Kundtz This simple book will help the reader create a life that is more peaceful, rewarding, and awakened. Being present can be defined as: Paying full attention to what is going on right now; Staying in the moment; Observing what is, without criticism or judgment; Having a balanced concern for things exactly as they are; Accepting whatever experience one is having; Having an awake participation in ongoing life. You can use this book as a reminder to be more present through every season of the year and every season of life. The book draws inspiration from poets, scientists, spiritual teachers, children, butterflies, and big cities, and teaches you to accept each day as one full of possibilities and potential surprises. You can find it on Amazon . 3. 52 Weeks of Self Reflection – Erika R. Dawkins This simple but powerful book will guide the reader through a full year of self-reflection through writing. Each week, the book will introduce you to a new topic that you will either reflect on immediately or incorporate into your life and reflect on at the end of the week. You can use this book to guide you through self-reflection. No matter your goal, this guidebook will help you clear your head, see the world from a new perspective, and build a greater understanding of yourself. You can find it on Amazon . A Take-Home Message In this piece, we defined introspection, described the importance of self-reflection (especially healthy self-reflection), and provided many example exercises, activities, and worksheets for you to enhance your understanding of yourself. Keep in mind that self-reflection is an intensely personal process. If you find other activities that work better for you, feel free to focus on those—but we’d love for you to come back here and share with us what works. Do you have any other techniques for self-reflection that you like to use? How important do you think introspection is for the average person, or for yourself? Let us know in the comments.

            "60  -  60 days of shadow work prompts for beginners\n",
            "The  -  The term ‘shadow work’ refers to the practice of working through and learning to forgive your shadow self.\n",
            "Your  -  Your shadow self is the side of you that you tend to hide from others and keep out of sight, hence the name.\n",
            "The  -  The Shadow is one of main archetypes that Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, focused on the most, along with the Self, the Persona, and the Anima/Animus.\n",
            "These  -  These archetypes are defined as universal, primal symbols and images that derive from the collective unconscious.\n",
            "Jung  -  Jung’s Shadow archetype is often likened to Sigmund Freud’s theory on the Id.\n",
            "The  -  The Id according to Freud, was the primitive part of the psyche responsible for sexual and aggressive drives, as well as hidden memories.\n",
            "The  -  The Superego is the moral conscious, while the Ego acts as the go-between.\n",
            "Freud  -  Freud’s Id and Jung’s Shadow contrast in certain aspects because Jung believed that not all Shadow traits were inherently negative and could even result in creativity, while Freud believed that the Id was primitive and purely driven by instinct.\n",
            "According  -  According to Jung, our Shadow is the side of us that the ego doesn’t identify with; the ‘darker’ side of our personality.\n",
            "While  -  While the traits that make up our Shadow as usually perceived to be negative – as our ego has hidden them for a reason – they can also be positive, as having low self-esteem or anxiety can cause us to unnecessarily reject certain aspects of ourselves that we’ve been taught are bad.\n",
            "Some  -  Some of us as children are just taught that we should be quiet, timid, and rational, and therefore view these as traits that we should bury.\n",
            "‘  -  ‘Modern’ shadow work refers to discovering these shadow traits, forgiving ourselves for them, healing from past trauma that may have caused them, and processing them in order to grow.\n",
            "We  -  We tend to see shadow traits in other people pretty easily, but when it comes to our own shadow self, it takes a little introspection.\n",
            "Shadow  -  Shadow traits that your shadow side might possess include: Anger/Outbursts of rage Envious/Jealous Manipulative/Exploitative Selfish/Self-centred Arrogant/Egotistical Obsessed with appearance/\n",

            "Our  -  Our shadow self usually begins to develop in childhood when we’re especially susceptible to soaking up the attitudes and energies of our environment, as well as experience trauma that we’re not yet equipped to deal with.\n",
            "You  -  You have to be vulnerable and super-honest with yourself, and that doesn’t always feel good.\n",
            "After  -  After all, this is why we’ve suppressed and hidden this shadow self for so long.\n",

            "Thinking  -  Thinking about our upbringing, environment growing up, trauma, and parents’ impact on our entire being because of their own toxic traits is also an immensely humbling experience.\n",
            "You  -  You finally realise that the people who raised you are also human and also have their own shadow selves.\n",

            "By  -  By suppressing our shadow selves, we’re not learning to work through our issues and become better human beings, we’re simply allowing our certain traits to fester and grow.\n",
            "Jung  -  Jung believed that this would result in the Shadow taking charge and pushing other, inauthentic traits to the surface, as well as projecting these unwanted traits onto other people, which can hamper relationships.\n",
            "This  -  This is not only exhausting, it can cause mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as we wrestle with the parts of ourselves we don’t want others to see, and, as a result, fail to work through them.\n",

            "Learning  -  Learning where my toxic, shadow traits have come from, how to work through them, and ultimately forgiving myself for being human has been liberating and uplifting.\n",
            "Therefore  -  Therefore, while challenging, recognising, accepting, and unpacking my toxic traits has been nothing short of life-changing.\n",

            "While  -  While I’m a firm believer that you don’t need to be spiritual to practise shadow work since learning self-acceptance and positive coping mechanisms is basically free therapy\n",
